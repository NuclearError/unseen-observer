Some of you may know me or perhaps only know of me, but to those who do not, my name is Diana Charmaigne, Royal Surgeon of Her Royal Majesty and Retainer to Lady Amoret. Since awakening to Castle Marrach fifteen years ago, I have devoted my life to the study of medicine and the human body and had the privilege to learn from the very best of instructors, primarily Lord Meilyr, my predecessor. I have learned what a truly amazing machine the body is and how marvelously it can heal itself, but sometimes an injury can be too traumatic for the body to handle alone. And sometimes, injured persons have found themselves in dire trouble alone. I earnestly hope that this should never befall anyone, but as many you have witnessed or perhaps experienced in the past, this indeed can happen. These are some steps so that you can take to help you help yourself, so I urge you to remember them, for they may one day save your life.\n~Managing Circulation~\nThis article addresses bleeding wounds and what you can do to help prevent you from acute exsanguination, or more commonly referred to as \"bleeding out\" and keep you alive until a Healer can see to your injury. There are several variations of bleeding wounds, but for any injury, though it is often against our nature to do so, remain calm. If you are anxious or panicked, it will cause your heart to beat all the more faster, causing you to effectively pump the blood more swiftly from your body. You will find you can think more clearly after some deep breaths and by keeping the life sustaining Humors inside your body where they belong.\n~Bleeding Wounds~\nFor bleeding wounds such as puncture wounds or lacerations (stabs and cuts), first apply pressure. You can use your hands if desperate, but it is best to use a cloth or bandage of some kind to protect your body from the outside world. Your hands interact with the environment more than any other part of your body, thus it is prudent to take measures to protect yourself from infection. If you do not have a bandage available, you can improvise supplies with your clothing. Handkerchiefs, small towels, or strips of cloth torn from a shirt or skirt and so forth can work quite well for improvised bandages. After all, these are measures to take to so you can stabilize yourself and swiftly find help. Take the material and fold it over the wound to help soak up the blood and apply firm pressure. When injured, your body is floods the wound with Humors to heal the wound, but if you are losing your blood volume too quickly, you may become ill, dizzy or light headed, weak and fatigued and lose possibly lose consciousness and even expire before the injury can care for itself and it shall be too late. Thus by applying pressure, you compress the blood vessels and force the wound closed. Keep firm and steady pressure until the bleeding slows or stops. It is important NOT to lift the bandage to check the wound. As the blood dries, it will essentially adhere the cloth to the wound; if you should lift it, you could tear the wound open.\n\nApply more cloth as needed until you stop the bleeding, then apply a pressure dressing by taking a long strip of cloth and wrapping the wound in firm overlapping layers. To tie the bandage, you may need to tear it down the middle and secure one half beneath the previous layer then tie it until it is secure. If the bandage is too tight, your skin will become cool around the effected area. If it begins to turn blue or ashen, you will need to loosen the bandage or else risk losing that part of your body or otherwise cause further harm to yourself. If the bandage is too loose, it will either fall off or the wound will tear open when you move again. Balance is the key to so many aspects of life, so I encourage you to practice so you may learn the sufficient amount of pressure required for you and improve your technique. If the wound continues to bleed and if it is located on a limb, by elevating the effected limb above your heart, you can help slow the blood flow via use of gravity and apply greater pressure.\n\nIf ice or snow is available, you can try wrapping it in a cloth and press it against the wound. This constricts the vessels and may help to slow or stop the bleeding which may help you from needing to take extreme measures to control the loss of blood. Keep the cold compress on for a chime, then remove it for a chime. You do not wish to over expose your skin to the cold for that can cause damage and complications of its own. Ironically enough, the ice and cold can burn your skin.\n~Quick Tips and Conclusion~\nIf injured by a bleeding wound:\nBe wary of your surroundings and be careful. Prevention of injury is the very best way to avoid risks to your body.\nCall or send for help. Try not to be alone in an emergent situation and seek aid as quickly as possible.\nRemain calm.\nIf in a safe environment, take stock of your person and evaluate your situation and proceed accordingly and calmly.\nFind a cloth if available and apply firm pressure to the wound When the bleeding stops, apply a pressure bandage\nApply a cold compress and elevate (if possible)\n\n\nIf you desire to learn more, you may send word to me or through my assistant, sera Katharin. Otherwise, we hope that you find this information valuable and that you stay safe and hale in Castle Marrach. But should you need our help, the Royal Healers are here to aid you.",

A loud knock erupted from the door to Lady Marigold's study, interrupting her work. Marigold set the goblet she was playing with on the carved oak table and called, \"Enter.\" A young man in a dark hood opened the door to the study.\n\n\"I am sorry to bother you, My Lady. I am sure you are quite busy...\" The man started but the lowered his voice choking back his fear. Marigold laughed softly.\n\n\"I have an open door for everyone, ser. What is your problem?\" The Lady asked.\n\nThe young man spoke up, \"Well you see, it's about my brother. His... His wife was murdered while he was away on a trip. But Inquisitor Johnson didn't believe him and has him locked away in a cell. I was hoping... hoping you could take a look and see what you could find, My Lady.\" Marigold nodded her head, she picked up a large sage melton bag.\n\n\"Very well, take me to the scene. When was the body found, do you know?\" Asked the Marigold.\n\n\"This night, My Lady. My brother returned only a few bells ago and noticed her body then.\" Answered the man. Marigold simply nodded at the man's words as she drifted to the door.\n\n~~~~~\nThe two arrived at the brother's home, Johnson was there supervising the collection of the body and was shocked to see Marigold. \"Wh... Why... are you here, My Lady.\" Johnson asked.\n\n\"To look at the scene of course. I was requested by the aggrieve's brother,\" She said as she indicated the young man, \"What was your name, ser.\"\n\nThe man spoke up, \"Tydus, My Lady.\"\n\nMarigold smiled at Tydus, \"A wonderful name, it means to have vision and foresight.\" Young Tydus blushed at the compliment.\n\nJohnson spoke up then, \"Yes, well. I can't very much have you wondering around the scene while the body is here. If you can wait a moment, My Lady.\" Marigold simply nodded and waited as the body was carried off in a large rugged sack.\n\nOnce the body was clear Johnson allowed Marigold and Tydus into the home. Johnson started asking Tydus questions then as Marigold searched the scene.\n\n\"So, you are the accused brother, eh?\" Asked Johnson.\n\nTydus nodded watching Marigold as she poked about the scene, \"Yes, Inquisitor.\"\n\n\"How did you hear about this incident then?\" Probed Johnson.\n\nTydus wrinkled his brow slightly as Marigold started feeling the blood with her bare hands, \"Um...\" Tydus shook his head, \"My brother alerted me on the way to your home, Inquisitor.\" Johnson nodded once at the man's words.\n\nJust as Johnson was opening his mouth to ask another question, Marigold stepped up to the two and spoke, \"The brother is innocent, Inquisitor.\"\nTo learn the conclusion of this tale of mystery, you are invited to attend a Reading in the Outer Bailey Library on the 8th day of the 1st moon of the 17th YRA at 8 Late Bells.\n\n\nHeraldry and Identity\nWrit by sera Eloren, on behalf of the Heralds\nIdentity is everything, it is truth. We identify ourselves with how we act, dress, and even in our actions.\n\nWhy is Blazonry so important? Before I can answer that, we have to understand what Heraldry actually is. Heraldry is a broad term used to refer to the duties of a herald and armory, armorial bearings and blazon. Armory and armorial bearings use symbols to identify which House the bearer represents. Historically, in battles, Knights would wear armor, use banners or carry shields with armorial bearings to distinguish which party they held fealty with and to insure the right person was being attacked.\n\nBlazon and Blazonry are terms used to represent the written and visual symbols of a shield or �coat of arms� that identify the family they represent. Basically, Blazonry displays a physical representation of your identity to others. There are many parts of a shield, each having their own meaning, identifying a part of the person who it belongs to. Every word, shape, figure and color on a shield stands for a different things. By looking at different recorded Coat of Arms of the Keep, we can see why Blazonry is so important. Let us look at the coat of arms for the group of the Heraldry.\n\nAzure or Blue part of the shield: Loyalty and Truth\nArgent or Silver Border: Innocence, Purity, Peace, Sincerity\nTrumpet: The Heralds identifier\n\n\nExamining the shield and its meanings, you can state that the Heralds are loyal, truthful, sincere and peaceful, among other things. Understanding each part, we can better form a conclusion of what ideals each person holds dear. It is amazing how many small parts of a whole can define so much more than you expect it to.\n\nSo in ending this article, I ask you this: What will be upon your Coat of Arms? How will your deeds define who you are?\nFrosty Fun Fest\nCollected works of the Chroniclers\nUnless you managed to sleep through one of the most festival-filled weeks of this year, we can expect you took part in this year's Frosty Fun Fest. In case you did somehow miss it, you can try to relive it through the works of the Office of the Royal Chroniclers:\nOpening Ceremony\nIndoor Game Night\nWomen's Social & Men's Gathering (Undocumented; you had to be there!)\nFashion Lecture & Auction\nOutdoor Games\nClosing Ceremony (Coming soon!)\n\nOpen PositionsThe Herald wishes to provide the castle residents with a list of currently-open positions amongst the available groups and guilds.

We identify ourselves with how we act, dress, and even in our actions.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>hy is Blazonry so important? Before I can answer that, we have to understand what Heraldry actually is. Heraldry is a broad term used to refer to the duties of a herald and armory, armorial bearings and blazon. Armory and armorial bearings use symbols to identify which House the bearer represents. Historically, in battles, Knights would wear armor, use banners or carry shields with armorial bearings to distinguish which party they held fealty with and to insure the right person was being attacked.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">B</span>lazon and Blazonry are terms used to represent the written and visual symbols of a shield or &#xFFFD;coat of arms&#xFFFD; that identify the family they represent. Basically, Blazonry displays a physical representation of your identity to others. There are many parts of a shield, each having their own meaning, identifying a part of the person who it belongs to. Every word, shape, figure and color on a shield stands for a different things. By looking at different recorded Coat of Arms of the Keep, we can see why Blazonry is so important. Let us look at the coat of arms for the group of the Heraldry.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><img class=\"bbcode-attachment\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YoL8jIk.png\" border=\"0\" alt></div><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Azure or Blue part of the shield: Loyalty and Truth</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Argent or Silver Border: Innocence, Purity, Peace, Sincerity</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Trumpet: The Heralds identifier</span></li>\n</ul><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">E</span>xamining the shield and its meanings, you can state that the Heralds are loyal, truthful, sincere and peaceful, among other things. Understanding each part, we can better form a conclusion of what ideals each person holds dear. It is amazing how many small parts of a whole can define so much more than you expect it to.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">S</span>o in ending this article, I ask you this: What will be upon your Coat of Arms?

Instead try a bodice or corseted vest, blouse, divided skirt (which is worn with pantalettes), girdle and slippers or appropriate feminine shoes for everyday. For a martial look for those who are Equerries substitute a girdle for a belt, as a girdle can not hold a sword, and the slippers for boots.\n\nThose not of link for this particular attire a skirt with a blouse and bodice with slippers is the appropriate everyday attire. Never pants.\n\nFor Men:\n\nTunics are worn with undertunics and some sort of pair of pants or hose for a more courtly look, but never with a doublet or a jerkin. Any ensemble that incorporates hose a codpiece is a must else it becomes indecent.\n\nLong-sleeved shirts are a must with jerkins, doublets, courtepies etc. The voluminous shirt is quite fashionable, and with sleeveless garments adding segemented sleeves creates a more fashionable overall appearance and adds a touch of artistry for men.\n\nFor a less martial look choose a non leather for jerkins and doublets, else choose from courtepies or mandilions or even the more fashionable tunics such as the high-collared one.\n\nChausses can be worn with braies, codpeice, undertunic and tunic or even over a pair of pants for a more fashionable appearance.\n\nAs always do be mindful or your link for items.

Honor is not a leisurely lifestyle, nor is it an unlearned thing. Many believe only men or women of steel and sword to be honorable, but there is honor in all things. You need not wield a sword, don a shield, and ride a steed into a battle for Honor. You can be a merchant who does not cheat, a lover who does not stray, or even a stable boy who works without complaint. We often forego any notion of virtues in lieu of 'Honor'. That is not what honor is for, nor is it how it should be used. Honor can not be true and without repute unless you are capable in some form or fashion, to exhibit the virtues together.\n\nI have seen many men and women come through the Castle, yet I have not seen much honor in the actions of the majority. I have always tried to be mindful of the virtues and my beliefs as a seeker. I understand that balance is a vital part of being an honorable man and though I have not always taken the most dignified approach to any issues or obstacles of my life within Marrach, I have always been sure of my opinion and myself. I accept my wrongs, I attempt to better myself so I do not repeat the same mistakes, and I attempt to balance my thoughts and views with the virtues as best as I am able. It is not about who can best who, or what rank you are...Honor does not rest, nor does it hide. It will always be the easiest thing to lose but the hardest to maintain. One can not be honorable some of the time. One must keep themselves aware of what they are doing, for the make of a man is not when the eyes are upon him -- but how he acts with his life.\n\nThe Wraiths, Part 1\nFirst of two parts\nWrit by Senior Chronicler Melle Scheralz\nThere are few denizens waking within the Castle in recent times that are unaware of the threat posed by the beings that most simply describe as \"the wraiths\". Though their appearances in the past few months have been rare, their continued machinations have been evident from the activity they have indirectly caused and by the misfortune that they have brought upon those who bear their mark. As one such marked individual, I take it upon myself here to bring some clarity regarding the situation to those who do not already know, that by improving awareness of the wraiths and their dark designs on the Castle we might lessen the risk they pose to our denizenry, as well as to the very magical equilibrium of our realm.\n\nSome might have heard these wraiths referred to by a different collective name, that of the \"Hand of Five.\" This title predates the wraiths themselves and even the time that we call Recent Awakenings, alluding to the living denizens of the Castle who would one day become the undead beings which now haunt it. Originally, the Hand of Five were sorcerers, apprentices of the one known by the title of the First Sorcerer. And just as their teacher was fated to live in infamy, so his disciples led an ignoble existence which culminated in their demise. Named as enemies of the Crown for practicing dark magics and for harrassing the denizenry as a part of the group known as the Black Rose, the five sorcerers eluded Sir Maugis and his then-assistant Master Odebain for long after their master's death, until by the efforts of the magic-sensitive sera Tyli they were located and killed, a quest which cost the sera her life. To ensure that they would never be resurrected, the bones of the sorcerers were crushed to dust, and for many years they existed only as a memory.\n\nSome years past, however, the memory of the Hand was brought forth quite suddenly, when in a dark ritual orchestrated by parties yet-unknown the five sorcerers were given new life of a sort in the form of five uncorporeal wraiths, identified by their colours of Red, Green, Blue, Purple and White. These wraiths quickly proved a significant threat to the castle, as they set about marking individual denizens in order to further their plans without regard to the life and health of those that they encountered. At the time they were very much an unknown quantity, and so an effort was made by sera Rikka and the Keepers of the Unveiled to summon a wraith forth and contain it in order to learn more of its purpose and intentions. Though the summoning did not proceed exactly as hoped, it brought forth an unexpected visitor, a grotesque representative of the group known as the Triangle. This entity proved a great deal more cooperative than the wraiths themselves, explaining that the wraiths were indeed phantoms of the five sorcerers known as the Hand, and that what they sought was life and physical form. The gruesome being also claimed that it was by the hand of the First Sorcerer that the wraiths had been brought forth, although their master had not been witnessed in many Moons. Finally the Triangle's representative offered a means to fight back against the wraiths, in the form of a magical scroll that he gave to the Castle's current sorcerers, before departing in a uniquely unpleasant manner.\n\nThus began the Castle's protracted struggle against the wraiths of the Hand. Time and again the wraiths made use of their powers to lay physical marks upon individuals of the Castle's denizenry, seemingly as a part of their plans to return to life, and time and again their attempts have been halted by the efforts of the denizenry and other involved entities. After the first series of \"markings\", when five denizens each found themselves wearing a mark from one of the wraiths on their bodies, the Hand were captured and confined by Master Odebain with the aid of the being known as Nef. After a long period, they were able to break free from this imprisonment, and at that time seemingly chose to do away with the previous marks and select five new victims. They succeeded in marking a few, but prepared by our previous encounters the denizenry were able to defend themselves against their attacks, in several cases even destroying individual wraiths when they made themselves known, with the aid of sorcerous magic or weapons of larch. It was at this time, however, that it was learned that doing away with individual wraiths was of no avail, as so long as at least one of the wraiths continued to exist, it could draw its comrades back from the brink of oblivion. In order for the threat to be ended conclusively, the Five would need to be brought to an end as one. When plans began to be made to bring about such a conclusion, however, the wraiths suddenly fell quiescent once more.",

With this training, it is our hope that they will learn not only how to use a blade, but to respect it and know when not to use a blade.\n\nOur primary activity is holding classes in swordsmanship. The primary focus of our sessions is training in skills and sparring. We also occasionally conduct lectures and drills surrounding blades, love for the blade, casks racing and much more.\n\nAll denizens are welcome, regardless of level of skill or affiliation, as long as they are courteous and respectful of our rules, our teachers, and their fellow students.\n\nRequirements:Attend Battle Guild practice sessions. Learn sword craft and display respect for martial matters. These will be posted upon the public board.\nRead the Battle Guild Charter and learn of our organization, and our beliefs and purpose.\nLearn to cheer thusly: \"Huzzah!\"\nSpeak to a Battler of your interest and to answer questions you may have. Also, send a missive to the Preceptor and he/she will get back to you.\n\n\nOn Beauty\nWrit by Mistress Ezraella\nBeauty is often described as a trait that goes beyond skin deep. It is certainly true that Inner Beauty shall forever outlast superficial beauty and loveliness of ones Soul outshines the fleeting loveliness of a pretty face.\n\nHowever, while you work on your Inner Beauty do not forget that how we present ourselves on the outside is merely a reflection of what we hope is seen in our hearts.\n\nAllow the stylists to tend to your outer beauty needs. A hair cut, a trim, a new style or offering soaps and oils for that dry skin - these are only a few of the things the Stylists have to offer.\n\nBy appointment or during open bells our Stylists are able to accommodate most schedules. Our Staff consists of Mistresses Ezraella and Brook, Stylists Yolanda and Khalea who may be contacted directly.\nOf Honour\nWrit by ser Melle Scheralz for Lord Bernier, provided by Lord Bernier\nHonour is a defining aspect of our society, here in Castle Marrach. In a meritocratic hierarchy such as our own, where rank, role and upward mobility is determined entirely by the favour of one's peers and those higher, the role of \"Honour\" as the invisible metric by which we are all judged cannot be overlooked. In more primitive and unsophisticated societies, where crimes are not codified in law but nonetheless need to be judged and punished, honour serves as the abstract concept which both condemns criminals and grants their arbitrators the right to lay down punishment. Similarly, in our Castle, for those whose behaviour is not in violation of crimes or common decency, but who nonetheless seem to give the impression of the unsavory or the uncongenial, honour is the deciding factor that places their worth as lesser and renders their station lower.\n\nThe chivalric virtues of the Castle exist to convey to denizens both high and low what it means to act in a manner that can be deemed \"honourable\". Though the Knights of the Realm exist to act as paragons of these virtues, and examples to inspire others, the virtues themselves apply to everyone to one extent or another. Virtues such as courtesy, franchise and honesty are expected of each denizen in their quotidien lives. Furthermore, in our Castle we are often granted the opportunity to display courage, prowess and fortitude, virtues which bring further esteem and respect upon ourselves. This is the essence of honour. As the currency of favour, it determines how one is viewed by others and the benefits they receive as a result. As the determiner of acceptable or even noble behaviour, it defines the very nature of Marrachian Society.",

          "text": "THE CLOCK TOWER HERALD\nIssue XII\n19th Day, 7th Moon, 17th Year of these Recent Awakenings\n\n-------------------------------\nA collection of articles and information about current castle life and events. \n\n\n\n\nWinter Watch\nWrit by Dame GalateaDenizens of Castle Marrach,\n\nThe Winter Watch of Castle Marrach is looking for active, trustworthy and honorable denizens of the realm to join its ranks.\n\nThe Winter Watch is the Crown's martial law enforcement organization, tasked with upholding the law and protecting the realm from both internal and external threats.\n\nDuring times of peace, the Winter Watch is tasked with upholding and enforcing the law of Castle Marrach as per the Queen�s Capitulary. Watchfolk are tasked with patrolling the castle halls and gathering areas to ensure that the castle populace is safe and that Peace and Order are maintained throughout the keep. Watchfolk are tasked to investigate into any instances in which they believe the law has been broken. Following said investigation, in some cases, Watchfolk are then tasked with dispensing justice in accordance with the Capitulary.\n\nThe Winter Watch also maintains a rigorous training schedule to ensure that all Watchfolk meet the standard expectations impressed upon them as soldiers charged with defending the realm. Even in times of peace, the Watch is more than just an agency of law enforcement, but a military organization, expected to protect the interests of the Realm from all external threats. Training in martial combat, military strategy, and the Marrachian legal system is exercised on a regular basis to keep Watch members in fighting shape for times of conflict.\n\nParties interested in joining the Winter Watch of Castle Marrach can send an application to the Watch recruiting officer (Armswoman Vessa) or the acting Corporal of the Watch (Dame Galatea). Battlers Guild\nWrit by Preceptor CarlaJoin Us:\n\nThe Battle Guild is a chartered Outer Bailey Guild, whose purpose is to train denizens in the art of the sword and in time desire to teach others, to ever increase the puissance and prowess of themselves and Her Majesty's denizens. With this training, it is our hope that they will learn not only how to use a blade, but to respect it and know when not to use a blade.\n\nOur primary activity is holding classes in swordsmanship. The primary focus of our sessions is training in skills and sparring. We also occasionally conduct lectures and drills surrounding blades, love for the blade, casks racing and much more.\n\nAll denizens are welcome, regardless of level of skill or affiliation, as long as they are courteous and respectful of our rules, our teachers, and their fellow students.\n\nRequirements:Attend Battle Guild practice sessions. Learn sword craft and display respect for martial matters. These will be posted upon the public board.\nRead the Battle Guild Charter and learn of our organization, and our beliefs and purpose.\nLearn to cheer thusly: \"Huzzah!\"\nSpeak to a Battler of your interest and to answer questions you may have. Also, send a missive to the Preceptor and he/she will get back to you.\n\n \nThe Wraiths, Part 2\nSecond of two parts\nWrit by Senior Chronicler Melle Scheralz\n\nIt was not until this year, and the intentional weakening of the Veil by Princess Maeve, that we learned what had happened to quiet the wraiths. In their conflict with us and due to their repeated wearying attempts to mark denizens in spite of aggressive resistance, the wraiths of the Hand had become weak. At a certain stage, when several of the wraiths had been destroyed by the efforts of our sorcerers and larch-wielding denizens, Master Odebain himself had once again been able to take action, binding two of the wraiths to his own body in order to prevent them from acting. The Red and Green wraiths now securely imprisoned, the remaining Blue, Purple and White had retreated into hiding, seemingly fearing the vulnerability that their reduced numbers might bring. Those that had been marked by them, however, continued to bear the evidence of their previous actions.\n\nMaster Odebain advised the Castle that this weakening of the Veil might once more encourage the wraiths into trying to further their plans. And so we of the Castle began to make plans of our own, to bring about the final end of the wraiths and with them any possibility that they might continue to renew themselves. Led by the Royal Collegium and its assembly of magical scholars and practitioners, these plans have chiefly centered on means by which we might bring the wraiths together to one location on our own terms, and there bring them to an end. Over time we learned more, that in order to truly end the threat of the sorcerers wraiths we would also need to assemble and destroy their Foci, items used by sorcerers to channel their magical power. These five Foci were originally given to the five great Magi of the Castle at the time of the Hand's deaths: Sir Maugis, Lady Serista, Master Orson, Doctor Getheaht and Master Odebain. And though not all are where they once were, bringing them together and preventing the wraiths from retrieving the items themselves became a mission of grave importance. The urgency of our mission was truly brought to light later on, however, when from various sources we learned that the efforts of the wraiths did not just threaten the lives of the marked denizens and risk the return of a malign magical force to the Castle; more than that, the magics being used by the wraiths to return themselves to life might permanently corrupt and destabilize the Castle's magical cycle of death and rebirth itself.\n\nDespite the high stakes of the struggle, however, the conflict with the wraiths has thus far shown promising progress, both in the collecting of their sorcerers Foci and in the preparations for a conclusive battle to bring about the final destruction of the Hand. In these efforts, the contributions of all denizens are welcomed, but it is foremost important to remember that the wraiths themselves, even individually, are highly dangerous beings, and should be treated with caution. Therefore I will try to give as much information here as I can to ensure that no denizen is left at risk out of ignorance.\n\nThe wraiths present themselves in numerous ways that make them quite unique among phantasms. Due to their distinctive colours, they cannot easily be mistaken for other spirits or shadows, and often they choose to engage the living first through conversation or other forms of interaction before attacking. Nonetheless, they are more than willing to inflict harm on those that cause them impedance or even annoyance, and as recent events have shown larch may not be as effective a weapon against the wraiths as it once was. As well as physical harm, and the weakening effects that they may have on individuals through the marks that they leave, the wraiths are capable of influencing the emotions of those around them through magical means. These effects can be just as harmful as their other techniques, and in the past some wraiths have even displayed power enough to cause denizens to violently attack their fellows. For these reasons and more, should any denizen experience any inexplicably heightened emotion, encounter a feeling of preternatural cold, or witness any other evidence of a wraith's appearance, they should seek out the company of others and alert the Watch if possible. The wraiths have recently shown reluctance to deal with larger groups of denizens, and thus if the threat appears it is best to seek safety in numbers.\n\nThe wraiths of the Hand of Five are only the latest in a long series of mystical adversaries faced by the Castle and its denizens. And though we do not underestimate the foe before us, neither do we allow ourselves to believe that we cannot influence the outcome of this struggle. Though we may be ensconced in ice and stone, and at the mercy of sleep and time, we are yet living beings, and in that we wield a power beyond any ghost or lingering undead. It is that warmth and life that the wraiths desire, and for the sake of the Castle, for balance and nature, and for our own lives, we will do all that we might to oppose them.\n\nHer Masterpieces\nWrit by Josie Brennan\n\nHer Majesty's hands are calm,\nas she molds us in Her care;\nShe crafts each single vessel,\nHer dreams reviving us aware.\n\nNo two vessels look alike,\nWe are sculpted individually;\nAll unique within Her sight,\nInfused with life and then set free.\n\nThe Royal Potter takes our souls,\nand turns them on Her wheel,\nUntil She shapes us each in turn\nTo know, to love, to feel.\n\nWe are all a work of art,\nmade in the labor of Her grace;\nAnd She fondly watches over us\nAs we learn our purpose and place.\n\nYes, the Dreamer's disk is mighty,\nand we may hope it never ceases!\nFor as long as it is revolving,\nWe are made Her masterpieces.\n\n\nThe Hunt\nWrit by Vaden Amberthorne, Short Story Winner\n\nThe hunter awakens again, no idea how much time has passed, but finding it to be mid day outside. He knows the can not linger longer lest he succomb to the wound turning on him. He crawls from the pine ignoring the pain in his injured shoulder. He can already feel the fever beginning to set into the shoulder. He hauls himself to his feet and begins his trek home. He knows the game will hold in the ice and snow.\n\nHe spends more time stumbling and falling than he does actually walking and loses consciousness several times on the trek, but eventually he sees the cabin in the distance. He tries pushing himself harder to get there but fails again. He slips on ice and slams his head against a stump, yet again being reduced to unconsciousness. He wakes again, and realizes that several hours have passed. He finds himself disoriented by the scent of stale hay and the strong smell of horse and goat and blood. He strains his eyes in the darkness and makes out the inside of his barn, it is dark inside. He pushes himself to his feet and notices that his shoulder has been wrapped in bandages. He pulls the door open and sees it is dark outside but he makes his way to the cabin easy enough.\n\nHe pushes the door open and steps in, only to find himself standing in a sticky fluid on the floor. He can't make out much because of the darkness, and there is a heavy smell of blood filling his nose. There is no glow from the fireplace, nor is there a lantern lit. Something is very very wrong. He moves further inward and bumps into a table that is overturned. He searches for a lantern and finds one on the mantle of the fireplace. He uses the flint and steel next to it and strikes a flame. As the light floods the room, he sees the grisly scene before him. The furniture is mostly broken, blood is splattered over the walls, and pooled on the floor.\n\nTo find out the complete story, this book will be within the Outer Bailey Library for all to enjoy.",

It is that warmth and life that the wraiths desire, and for the sake of the Castle, for balance and nature, and for our own lives, we will do all that we might to oppose them.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:georgia\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:48px\">H</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">er Masterpieces</span></span></span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><i>Writ by Josie Brennan</i></span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:24px\">H</span>er Majesty&apos;s hands are calm,<br>\nas she molds us in Her care;<br>\nShe crafts each single vessel,<br>\nHer dreams reviving us aware.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">N</span>o two vessels look alike,<br>\nWe are sculpted individually;<br>\nAll unique within Her sight,<br>\nInfused with life and then set free.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">T</span>he Royal Potter takes our souls,<br>\nand turns them on Her wheel,<br>\nUntil She shapes us each in turn<br>\nTo know, to love, to feel.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">W</span>e are all a work of art,<br>\nmade in the labor of Her grace;<br>\nAnd She fondly watches over us<br>\nAs we learn our purpose and place.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">Y</span>es, the Dreamer&apos;s disk is mighty,<br>\nand we may hope it never ceases!<br>\nFor as long as it is revolving,<br>\nWe are made Her masterpieces.</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:48px\">T</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">he Hunt</span></span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><i>Writ by Vaden Amberthorne, Short Story Winner</i></span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:24px\">T</span>he hunter awakens again, no idea how much time has passed, but finding it to be mid day outside. He knows the can not linger longer lest he succomb to the wound turning on him. He crawls from the pine ignoring the pain in his injured shoulder. He can already feel the fever beginning to set into the shoulder. He hauls himself to his feet and begins his trek home. He knows the game will hold in the ice and snow.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">H</span>e spends more time stumbling and falling than he does actually walking and loses consciousness several times on the trek, but eventually he sees the cabin in the distance. He tries pushing himself harder to get there but fails again. He slips on ice and slams his head against a stump, yet again being reduced to unconsciousness. He wakes again, and realizes that several hours have passed. He finds himself disoriented by the scent of stale hay and the strong smell of horse and goat and blood. He strains his eyes in the darkness and makes out the inside of his barn, it is dark inside. He pushes himself to his feet and notices that his shoulder has been wrapped in bandages. He pulls the door open and sees it is dark outside but he makes his way to the cabin easy enough.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">H</span>e pushes the door open and steps in, only to find himself standing in a sticky fluid on the floor. He can&apos;t make out much because of the darkness, and there is a heavy smell of blood filling his nose. There is no glow from the fireplace, nor is there a lantern lit. Something is very very wrong. He moves further inward and bumps into a table that is overturned. He searches for a lantern and finds one on the mantle of the fireplace. He uses the flint and steel next to it and strikes a flame. As the light floods the room, he sees the grisly scene before him. The furniture is mostly broken, blood is splattered over the walls, and pooled on the floor.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><i>To find out the complete story, this book will be within the Outer Bailey Library for all to enjoy.</i></span></div>"

Watchfolk are tasked with patrolling the castle halls and gathering areas to ensure that the castle populace is safe and that Peace and Order are maintained throughout the keep. Watchfolk are tasked to investigate into any instances in which they believe the law has been broken. Following said investigation, in some cases, Watchfolk are then tasked with dispensing justice in accordance with the Capitulary.\n\nThe Winter Watch also maintains a rigorous training schedule to ensure that all Watchfolk meet the standard expectations impressed upon them as soldiers charged with defending the realm. Even in times of peace, the Watch is more than just an agency of law enforcement, but a military organization, expected to protect the interests of the Realm from all external threats. Training in martial combat, military strategy, and the Marrachian legal system is exercised on a regular basis to keep Watch members in fighting shape for times of conflict.\n\nParties interested in joining the Winter Watch of Castle Marrach can send an application to the Watch recruiting officer (Armswoman Vessa) or the acting Corporal of the Watch (Dame Galatea). Battlers Guild\nWrit by Elder CarlaJoin Us:\n\nThe Battle Guild is a chartered Outer Bailey Guild, whose purpose is to train denizens in the art of the sword and in time desire to teach others, to ever increase the puissance and prowess of themselves and Her Majesty's denizens. With this training, it is our hope that they will learn not only how to use a blade, but to respect it and know when not to use a blade.\n\nOur primary activity is holding classes in swordsmanship. The primary focus of our sessions is training in skills and sparring. We also occasionally conduct lectures and drills surrounding blades, love for the blade, casks racing and much more.\n\nAll denizens are welcome, regardless of level of skill or affiliation, as long as they are courteous and respectful of our rules, our teachers, and their fellow students.\n\nRequirements:Attend Battle Guild practice sessions. Learn sword craft and display respect for martial matters. These will be posted upon the public board.\nRead the Battle Guild Charter and learn of our organization, and our beliefs and purpose.\nLearn to cheer thusly: \"Huzzah!\"\nSpeak to a Battler of your interest and to answer questions you may have. Also, send a missive to the Preceptor and he/she will get back to you.\n\n The Royal Armoury\nWrit by Royal Armorer, Mistress Wilenea\n\nThe Armoury has redone its guidelines and now offers arms and armour for a price in coins, links still apply, and the full guidelines can be found upon the public board. Orders should be sent to Mistress Wilena and never Dame Eeva directly, who is the weaponsmith alongside Master Quilp at this time, further weapons are still to be registered.\n\n\nThe Clothiers\nWrit by Acting Royal Seamstress, Mistress Wilena\n\nThe clothiers are not taking on any further students at this time.

          "text": "On Beauty\nChoosing The Best Hair Color For You\nWrit by Mistress Josie Changing up your hair color is never as simple as selecting a swatch from a book and deciding that you definitely want it. There is always that underlying fear that you will transform into something hideous and unappealing. That's why, when you're trying to find a suitable hair color, you should take into account your skin tone and color theory. It's less about the hair color you like or want, and more about what hair color will actually complement your skin tone and make your favorite facial features pop. If you make a poor choice you could end up looking washing out, tired, unnatural, and *gasp* old!\n\nThe biggest rule of thumb is that your natural hair color is the shade range that you should stay within. Go too far outside of it and you're likely to wind up with hair that is damaged, dull, and fake looking against your skin tone. You may think that they appear to be completely different colors at first glance, but your skin and natural hair color have all the same underlying pigments. If you were born with black or brown hair, you will likely have warmer, earthier undertones in your skin like orange, brown, gold, or orange-based red. If you were born with blonde hair, you probably have cooler skin undertones like blue, green, pink, or blue-based red.\n\nThose with warmer undertones in their skin will look better with warmer hair colors like golden blondes or honey browns. Conversely, those with cooler undertones in their skin will look better with cooler hair colors, like ash blonde, black, or auburn brown. Generally the makeup you are using (if you use makeup, and we highly recommend you do!) should already tell you if you are a warm or cool toned person, but if you're unsure all you have to do is look at a vein in your arm under natural light. If it appears green, then you have warm tones, and if it is blue then you have cool-toned skin.\n\nThe color of the eyes is another indicator as to what hair shade you should go with. if you are eyes are deep brown, black, blue-grey, dark blue or hazel with white, grey, or blue flecks, you look best with cooler tones in your hair. If your eyes are golden brown, green, turquoise, or hazel with gold or brown fleck, you will look best with warm tones in your hair. Here is some general advice for different colors and skin tones that you might find useful.\n Blonde hair color for light skin tones:\nYou should opt for a golden, strawberry, or light blonde. Warming up your hair with highlights can add some color and interest to your tresses and your face, but because you are fairer skinned, you want to stay away from shades that are white, ash, and reddish.\n Blonde hair color for medium skin tones:\nYour skin has more color than those of the fair tone, so you can logically add more color to your hair. A golden hue will look lovely, as will a beige-blonde, or even a light blonde. Just be sure to maintain some warmer tones to match the glow of your skin. Ashy or orange-based shades will make you look washed out.\n Blonde hair color for darker skin tones:\nIf you have dark skin, stick with darker blonde shades on your hair. You don't want to move too far away from your natural hair color, so if your skin tone is dark, chances are your hair is naturally dark too. Caramel or golden highlights can be a beautiful enhancement to what you might currently wear. You should avoid tones with too much white, platinum, or orange because they will look unnatural.\n Brown hair color for light skin tones:\nStaying somewhat true to your natural color most likely means keeping your hair a medium brown shade. Warm red tones can transform you into a masterpiece, as well as lighter strawberry tones, particularly with highlights. Unless you were born with it, you should avoid overly dark hair, as fair skinned women usually don't even have enough pigment in their skin to pull it off attractively.\n Brown hair color for medium skin tones:\nFor those with sallow or yellow undertones, medium browns work best. You have more versatility with them and can go lighter or darker from a caramel shade to a rich auburn. You need to focus on keeping it neutral and not going to any warm or cool extremes.\n Brown hair color for dark skin tones:\nFor olive skin, dark colors work best and look the most natural. You can pull off deep tones of brown with darker red highlights. If you have pink undertones to your skin, try something softer like amber. As always, you should not stray too far from your natural color, and should avoid going too light as it will clash with your complexion.\n Black hair color for light skin tones:\nFor those with fair skin, dark, neutral tones that border on the dark brown side are best. You don't want to go too dark or it will wash you out and highlight the red pigments in your skin, making you look unnaturally rosy.\n Black hair color for medium skin tones:\nYou should choose a shade that is dark brown to almost black to complement the color in your skin. No matter what you need to avoid reddish-black hues because they will bring out the yellow in your complexion and make you look abnormal.\n Black hair color for dark skin tones:\nDue to the fact that you have a darker skin tone, you can go with a super dark and bold brown or most shades of black. You want to steer clear of anything with a blue-black tone in it, as it will bring out too much of the olive undertones in your skin and may cast a greenish hue.\n Red hair color for light skin tones:\nFair skin looks best with a light, golden strawberry blonde to a bright copper or red. You want to avoid wine-like colors and burgundy because these shades will make you look too pale and sickly.\n Red hair color for medium skin tones:\nDue to the increased pigmentation in your skin, your hair can accommodate more colors. You should opt for medium coppery blondes to medium auburn shades, and stay away from dark eggplant hues or overly vibrant colors as they will make your skin appear yellow.\n Red hair color for dark skin tones:\nDarker skin tones look the best with a medium auburn to chestnut brown shade. Super red hues tend to have too much blue in them and will make you look green, so you should take care to avoid this if at all possible.\n\nOf course, if you don't particularly care how your hair color affects your appearance and you're just a dye fanatic for fun, then you needn't pay any attention to these guidelines or suggestions, but for those of us who often struggle with knowing what might best suit, we hope this provides some aid.\n\n Female Martial Attire and You\nWrit by Senior Clothier, sera Nataha\n\nBeing a martial woman in Castle Marrach does not come without a pile of unique challenges. In order to assist the female denizens the Clothiers would like to present the following information for martial women:Martial clothing should not be worn everyday. Martial attire should only be work when you are participating in a duel, sparring or on a planned excursion or encounter.\n* Women in uniform are the exception.Any female outfit that includes pants should be worn with a martial dress and gown, a skirted bodice, or corseted doublet when available.\n* Examples of dresses and gowns are the split-skirt dress, bell-sleeved split-skirt gown, high-collared overgown, knee-length split-skirt overgown, calf-length split-skirt overgown.The martial skirt (a skirt with pants built in) and the divided skirt may be worn everyday and also as martial attire.\nBoots are for martial attire only. Boots are not to be worn with skirts or dresses (except for the divided skirt)\nBlouses or shirts must be worn under bodices.\nWhen in doubt ask a clothier. We understand that some people prefer to wear pants in non martial situations. Work with us to find an outfit that is comfortable for you and respectful of the guidelines.",

          "text": "A Brief Study On Metals\nWrit by Royal Armorer, Mistress Wilenea\n\nThe basic metals used are copper, brass, bronze and steel there are also several variations of these from pale, dark, black and even white to name a few. Do note that none of the metals are discoloured with the use of gemstones which would make all weapons more akin to glass and ruin their integrity completely. The process of discolouration is either through tempering, natural deposits, or through other means, none of which would cause damage to the weapons integrity.\n\nThis will begin with copper, which is the softest of all the metals used by the Armoury. It is generally best for small arms though it is not unheard of to have a full sword made of such, though it is not advised as tis prone to bending and even breaking. After this comes brass, an alloy of copper, but one that is not as strong as bronze, however it is better than copper, thus useful for more than small arms, which brings me to bronze. This is the best material an Honoured Guest could order, tis light yet sturdier than copper, but not as sturdy as steel and may be used for sidearms or swords plus a few other weapons. A weapon of copper costs no more nor less than one of brass or bronze all three are equal in price dependent upon the weapon.\n\nSteel is an alloy of iron which requires the use of tempering, it should nay be any secret that tempering is the rapid cooling and heating of the metal at very precise intervals. It is due to this method that it is strong and flexible thus making this material the most desired for weapons, and why it is not offered beneath the rank of Courtier, as well as costing more than other materials listed.\n\nIt will be noted here that iron itself is not offered through the Royal Armoury at any link, out of tradition and a show of respect. This material by itself is also very heavy, unwieldy, and not as sturdy as steel.\n\n\nInteracting with Newly Dawned\nWrit by Mistress Josie\n\nThe newly dawned need our empathy and acceptance when they first wake. Just starting out here, they need to know that their feelings are legitimate and that expressing them is okay. Smiling, laughing, or making fun of them when they are distressed might seem more benevolent than reacting angrily or telling them to just be quiet, but the message is the same: They shouldn't be upset. They shouldn't be confused or panicked. Their feelings aren't valid or acceptable. They are learning to maneuver in a whole new life, in a whole new body, and this leaves them with a sense that there's something wrong with them. They need to be met with understanding and given assurances and answers insomuch as we are capable of giving.\n\nOutbursts from the get-go may appear to be unreasonable or an overreaction to this gift of life given to us. Still, we must do all we can to remain patient and let these waves of emotion pass. Feelings are just feelings, and they don't always make sense. If we make the effort to acknowledge all the crazy, difficult feelings, and also to understand them, we help these newcomers to understand them too. They feel unequivocally loved and supported in the process.\n\nIt's rare to meet an Awakener, or any guest for that matter, that doesn't have the instinct to please others. Most of us want to do whatever it takes to make each other happy. This is a great instinct except when it leads us to faking our own happiness, stifling or indulging other people in order to avoid hearing their objections, or neglecting opportunities to provide their behaviors the boundaries they need. When our priority is to keep them smiling at all costs, we don't help ourselves or them in the long run.\n\nWe need to model honesty. We are powerful models to the newly dawned and each other, and authenticity has to run both ways. People can read expressions easily enough and while we may be smiling and playing games, they know when we're actually annoyed, bored, angry, or too distracted to actually be present. It's a very disconcerting thing to be on the receiving end of this dual message: 'I'm here, but I'm not here'. 'I care about you, but but I'm not willing to invest my time or attention in you.' We should accept the feelings of others, both positive and negative, and allow them to learn about us. We need to be genuine and honest in our interactions with each other.\n\nAnyone attempting to learn anything deserves a calm, direct, and honest response along with a bit of instruction or guidance. The newly dawned in particular don't want to be an annoyance to anyone, but they have to test and question until they know for certain what we expect them to do or not do. When we avoid answering these queries or confronting their requests and instead distract them or set limits, their need for clarification and boundaries is not being met. As a result, they might continue on in this manner for much longer than is necessary. We shouldn't underestimate their, or anyone elses, ability to understand or cope with a truthful response.",
          "html": "<span style=\"font-family:times new roman\"><span style=\"font-size:48px\">A</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\"> Brief Study On Metals</span></span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman\"><i>Writ by Royal Armorer, Mistress Wilenea</i></span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman\"><span style=\"font-size:24px\">T</span>he basic metals used are copper, brass, bronze and steel there are also several variations of these from pale, dark, black and even white to name a few. Do note that none of the metals are discoloured with the use of gemstones which would make all weapons more akin to glass and ruin their integrity completely. The process of discolouration is either through tempering, natural deposits, or through other means, none of which would cause damage to the weapons integrity.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">T</span>his will begin with copper, which is the softest of all the metals used by the Armoury. It is generally best for small arms though it is not unheard of to have a full sword made of such, though it is not advised as tis prone to bending and even breaking. After this comes brass, an alloy of copper, but one that is not as strong as bronze, however it is better than copper, thus useful for more than small arms, which brings me to bronze. This is the best material an Honoured Guest could order, tis light yet sturdier than copper, but not as sturdy as steel and may be used for sidearms or swords plus a few other weapons. A weapon of copper costs no more nor less than one of brass or bronze all three are equal in price dependent upon the weapon.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">S</span>teel is an alloy of iron which requires the use of tempering, it should nay be any secret that tempering is the rapid cooling and heating of the metal at very precise intervals. It is due to this method that it is strong and flexible thus making this material the most desired for weapons, and why it is not offered beneath the rank of Courtier, as well as costing more than other materials listed.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:24px\">I</span>t will be noted here that iron itself is not offered through the Royal Armoury at any link, out of tradition and a show of respect. This material by itself is also very heavy, unwieldy, and not as sturdy as steel.</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:georgia\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-size:48px\">I</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">nteracting with Newly Dawned</span></span></span><br>\n<i>Writ by Mistress Josie</i></span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman\"><span style=\"font-size:24px\">T</span>he newly dawned need our empathy and acceptance when they first wake.

          "text": "How to accessorize with jewelry; Part One\nWrit by Apprentice Jeweler, Mistress Adeline\nJewelry has been within this keep for years and is still one of the most active crafting guilds because it caters to everyone. No matter the rank or gender you'll find something for you. While jewelry is used for many things, the major reason is to accessorize. Jewelry can make a huge difference with any outfit.\n\nIt can give you that pop you were missing to pull your outfit together as well as aiding to change a look from casual to formal. There's absolutely no reason not to upgrade up your look with jewelry. The best part about jewelry is that you can design it to your own personal style. Have fun with it and make a statement about your style.\n\nThis article will be a five-part series in which I will go over different ways to include jewelry with your outfit and how to correctly do so.\n\nWhat Is The Occasion?\nThe occasion is the most important part of pairing jewelry with an outfit. It would be utterly tragic if you were to pair fancy chandelier earrings with martial attire.For casual everyday outfits, drop necklaces and drop earrings are suitable. Something that is fine, but not over-the-top.\nFor martial attire dainty pieces of jewelry such as studs and hairpins are perfect.\nFor formal wear, bring out your lavish and brightest pieces. Such as cascading necklaces and hair decorations.\n\n\n\nWith that being said, do remember to order within your station. You may ask a jeweler if you are unsure. And always remember that fashion is art, so be sure to express yourself through that art and make each outfit from your own unique style.\n\n\nThe Art of Grooming: A Guide to Facial Hair\nWrit by Outer Lead Stylist, Mistress Josie\nThere's an art to being a well groomed gentleman. Today more than ever facial hair styles play a role in fashion, both within the Court and without. Whatever your signature style, from classic, clean cut to rugged stubble, following the proper grooming regimen will keep you looking your best.\n\nIf you don't want to mess with facial hair, a clean shave is definitely your best bet. To create this classic look a daily shave is a must, but, unlike other styles, there is no trimming or styling required. It's a universal look that can take years off your appearance. Arm yourself with the best razor you can order, and be certain to keep the blade clean to ensure great results. Apply a mild soap in the area that needs cleaning up to aid in an effortless glide while eliminating friction and resulting in a comfortable, ultra smooth shave. Use light, gentle strokes without applying too much pressure which can cause skin irritation. Pull your skin taut to create an even canvas and begin shaving with the grain, allowing the razor to do its job. If necessary, follow up by going against the grain for a deeper, closer shave.\n\nDesigner stubble is a masculine and sexy way to add definition to your face. The darkness of a day's worth of hair adds flattering contours and a bit of mysteriousness to any presence. To keep your stubble looking stylish and not scruffy you need a sharp razor capable of creating straight, seamless lines. The key to this look is keeping the growth trimmed. With your razor in hand, start by outlining the area being sure to distinguish between the stubble and clean shaven area. Next using your blade, trim your face and jaw line making sure to trim in the opposite direction of growth for crisp lines and definition. To maintain this look, daily maintenance is key; be certain to shape and sculpt every morning and whisk away random cheek hairs.\n\nOne of the more popular trends, the goatee is the new go-to look. It features a small patch of hair on the chin paired with a thin mustache. A similar style, known as the soul patch, boasts a dab of hair just under the bottom lip. To create the successful look, it needs to be regularly shaped and trimmed. Let your facial hair grow out. After a few days you'll get a sense of how and where your facial hair grows. Using your razor, clean shave your neck and the sides of your face leaving only the hair around your chin and mouth area. Grab your blade and a pair of scissors to expertly shape the goatee and trim hair to the desired length ensuring it is symmetrical. Comb the goatee downward and carefully trim any uneven hairs, lest it look bushy and unkempt. The outer edges of this style should never extend past your smile lines.\n\nA full beard isn't an excuse to stop shaving. Rather, it is a strong personality statement that needs attentive grooming. The secret to a stellar beard is meticulous sculpting and regular trimming. Let your hair grow for several weeks so that it has time to become full and even. When you're ready to sculpt your look begin by combing your beard in the direction it grows prior to trimming. Clean shave your neck and upper cheek area to outline and contour the shape of your beard. Utilize scissors and a long comb to cut your beard to the desired length working your way from the top to the bottom until you find the look that best suits you. Symmetry is key; trim the outer edges for smooth lines and contour around your mouth to finish off the grooming session. To keep your style tame and neat, you should shave your neck and upper cheeks regularly to maintain clean lines.\n\nStyling Millinery\nWrit by Apprentice Seamstress, sera Trinity\nWithin the Clothiers, we have many pieces that can be included in an outfit to accessorize. \"But why do we need to accessorize?\" some may ask. Well, I'll tell you, when you include hats, scarfs, gloves, and more, you take your outfit from normal to extraordinary. Suppose you are with a sera and you happen to both have the same style of gown. Out of the two of you, the woman with the best accessories will stand out more. Leaving the other woman to look dull and uncreative. Therefore, I'll be giving some tips on how to choose the right head accessories to go with your outfits.\n\nMatching With Your Outfit:\nWhile you first need to decide what hat you'll wear, you must also know how to wear it. Put a little flair into and tilt that hat so it's worn at an angle. This will make your hat look more interesting than simply just putting it straight on your head.\n\nYour hairstyle also matters when it comes to hats, they usually work best when your hair is pulled to the back, straight, curled, or tucked behind your ears. The adjustment will change too, depending on the style so be sure to practice in a mirror.\n\nHow To Wear A Hat:\nSo we all want to avoid overly matching or using the same color over-and-over. This is how to avoid that. When choosing head accessories, I find that matching them to your cloak, gloves, purse and/or shoes is the best way. These are all pieces to enhance the outfit you're already wearing.\n\nFor example, if you have a blue-grey gown, you could include an ivory headband that matches to your purse, choker, cloak and gloves. Furthermore, embroidery is another way to match with your headband, if done in the same color of the headband. These could be added to the gown and slippers. That is a wonderful way to match and still look fashionable.\n\nTop Five Feminine Head Accessories:Headbands; are simple head items that work well with nearly any hairstyle. It's easy to wear and even easier to include in an outfit.\nRibbons; much like headbands, this is also a simplistic headwear. Ribbons are entirely feminine and for the gentler sera. It can be adjusted in many different ways, around a pony, like a headband, within braids, and much more.\nFlat Caps; are exclusively for men to add a polish to their outfits. These hats tell us that you care about your appearance and will aid in pulling the outfit together. So yes, even men can accessorize.\nPillbox Hat; is my absolute favorite of the list. These hats are the picture of elegance and grace. Pillbox hats are small, decorative and appealing to eyes on any wearer because they work with just about any face shape. This style of hat works best with loose styles as well as pulled back styles.\nCirclet/veils; are delicate headpieces that are very versatile depending on the person and their rank. You wear these at formal events, mostly, but they can also be incorporated into everyday outfits.\n\n\nIf these tips aren't enough, feel free to contact a seamstress for further assistance.",

No matter the rank or gender you&apos;ll find something for you. While jewelry is used for many things, the major reason is to accessorize. Jewelry can make a huge difference with any outfit.<br>\n<br>\nIt can give you that pop you were missing to pull your outfit together as well as aiding to change a look from casual to formal. There&apos;s absolutely no reason not to upgrade up your look with jewelry. The best part about jewelry is that you can design it to your own personal style. Have fun with it and make a statement about your style.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>his article will be a five-part series in which I will go over different ways to include jewelry with your outfit and how to correctly do so.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>hat Is The Occasion?<br>\nThe occasion is the most important part of pairing jewelry with an outfit. It would be utterly tragic if you were to pair fancy chandelier earrings with martial attire.</div></span><div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">For casual everyday outfits, drop necklaces and drop earrings are suitable. Something that is fine, but not over-the-top.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">For martial attire dainty pieces of jewelry such as studs and hairpins are perfect.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">For formal wear, bring out your lavish and brightest pieces. Such as cascading necklaces and hair decorations.</span></li>\n</ul><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>ith that being said, do remember to order within your station. You may ask a jeweler if you are unsure. And always remember that fashion is art, so be sure to express yourself through that art and make each outfit from your own unique style.<br>\n</span></div><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:48px\">T</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">he Art of Grooming: A Guide to Facial Hair</span><br>\n<i>Writ by Outer Lead Stylist, Mistress Josie</i><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>here&apos;s an art to being a well groomed gentleman. Today more than ever facial hair styles play a role in fashion, both within the Court and without. Whatever your signature style, from classic, clean cut to rugged stubble, following the proper grooming regimen will keep you looking your best.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">I</span>f you don&apos;t want to mess with facial hair, a clean shave is definitely your best bet. To create this classic look a daily shave is a must, but, unlike other styles, there is no trimming or styling required. It&apos;s a universal look that can take years off your appearance. Arm yourself with the best razor you can order, and be certain to keep the blade clean to ensure great results. Apply a mild soap in the area that needs cleaning up to aid in an effortless glide while eliminating friction and resulting in a comfortable, ultra smooth shave. Use light, gentle strokes without applying too much pressure which can cause skin irritation. Pull your skin taut to create an even canvas and begin shaving with the grain, allowing the razor to do its job. If necessary, follow up by going against the grain for a deeper, closer shave.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">D</span>esigner stubble is a masculine and sexy way to add definition to your face. The darkness of a day&apos;s worth of hair adds flattering contours and a bit of mysteriousness to any presence. To keep your stubble looking stylish and not scruffy you need a sharp razor capable of creating straight, seamless lines. The key to this look is keeping the growth trimmed. With your razor in hand, start by outlining the area being sure to distinguish between the stubble and clean shaven area. Next using your blade, trim your face and jaw line making sure to trim in the opposite direction of growth for crisp lines and definition. To maintain this look, daily maintenance is key; be certain to shape and sculpt every morning and whisk away random cheek hairs.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">O</span>ne of the more popular trends, the goatee is the new go-to look. It features a small patch of hair on the chin paired with a thin mustache. A similar style, known as the soul patch, boasts a dab of hair just under the bottom lip. To create the successful look, it needs to be regularly shaped and trimmed. Let your facial hair grow out. After a few days you&apos;ll get a sense of how and where your facial hair grows. Using your razor, clean shave your neck and the sides of your face leaving only the hair around your chin and mouth area. Grab your blade and a pair of scissors to expertly shape the goatee and trim hair to the desired length ensuring it is symmetrical. Comb the goatee downward and carefully trim any uneven hairs, lest it look bushy and unkempt. The outer edges of this style should never extend past your smile lines.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">A</span> full beard isn&apos;t an excuse to stop shaving. Rather, it is a strong personality statement that needs attentive grooming. The secret to a stellar beard is meticulous sculpting and regular trimming. Let your hair grow for several weeks so that it has time to become full and even. When you&apos;re ready to sculpt your look begin by combing your beard in the direction it grows prior to trimming. Clean shave your neck and upper cheek area to outline and contour the shape of your beard. Utilize scissors and a long comb to cut your beard to the desired length working your way from the top to the bottom until you find the look that best suits you. Symmetry is key; trim the outer edges for smooth lines and contour around your mouth to finish off the grooming session. To keep your style tame and neat, you should shave your neck and upper cheeks regularly to maintain clean lines.<br>\n</div><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:48px\">S</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">tyling Millinery</span><br>\n<i>Writ by Apprentice Seamstress, sera Trinity</i><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>ithin the Clothiers, we have many pieces that can be included in an outfit to accessorize. &quot;But why do we need to accessorize?&quot; some may ask.

          "text": "How to Write a Story\nWrit by Senior Librarian, sera Calamity\nShort stories come in both long, short, simple and complex versions. Before you attempt to write one, you need to have a good understanding of what one looks like, how it flows, and how many words, more or less, are generally contained in one. If you've never read one, you're going to find it exceedingly difficult to write one. It would be no different than trying to describe a food you have never tasted or looked upon. Locate a couple of short stories in the Outer Bailey Library and study one or two closely to help improve your understanding of the form.\n\nBefore you begin writing, attempt to create a one-sentence summary of your story that captures its essence. The basic formula for this is your character along with a descriptor followed by an event followed by a conflict. For example; A large, brutish man is found crazed and wandering the hallways after strangling his best friend. -- This will help you understand what your story is about.\n\nOnce you have done this, the next step is to simply write. Put stylus to parchment without worrying about what comes out. It isn't important, as you only need to get your short story started. You will need to write at least fifty percent more words than you'll end up with in your finalized copy so that you have a multitude of options to select from when cutting out the mediocre.\n\nAfter you write your first draft, you need to start cutting, rewriting, and editing. This is the hardest part of the process and can feel quite like wading through a mucky swamp. Ensure you pick out the best words and thoughts from your initial draft and cut the excess while building up more around what's important to the central story. Once you have done a second, third, even fourth draft, make sure you read it aloud several times to find any grammatical errors or poorly written sections and fix accordingly.\n\nFinally, it's time to send your creativity out into the Castle. Don't overthink it, just do it. Courier your book to Guildmistress Adeline of the OB Library in submission and for approval and let your masterpiece become part of the history of Marrach.\nWhat is Loyalty\nWrit by Squire Natasha\nLoyalty is the basis of our moral path. It is the ground work for the ideals we hold above all else and for the sacrifices we will make. To be loyal is to walk a path that aligns with your personal values.\n\nWe generally think of loyalty to a person as being the foundation of this virtue. Loyalty to a person requires a tangible relationship and previous and frequent interaction. This is someone we know and admire, not someone we�ve merely heard about. One must be willing to GIVE in the relationship, to set aside personal needs and desires for the benefit of the person in which they are loyal.\n\nWnother way in which we exhibit loyalty is to a set of ideals. Ideals are beliefs set forth by society, the people we are loyal to or causes. One could be loyal to the ideal that they will hold doors for a sera, or that they will not indulge in drinking or smoking. These ideals are the map to their decisions and choices within the Castle. They guide each and every step that we take, and we oblige these ideals more than anything else. Loyalty, like all other virtues, can be abused. Specifically through blind loyalty, which is detrimental to abiding this virtue in a balanced way. One must not sacrifice their loyalties to an ideal in order to blindly be loyal to a person. Blind loyalty suggests that we can not think for ourselves, and that we are unable to determine what it is that we hold dear. We must always weigh the value of each loyalty and make choices with much thought and introspection.\n\nConflicts in loyalties will often occur. We may find that we are loyal to two people who end up in conflict with one another, or who hold value in a set of ideals that conflict with one another. Loyalties CAN change, and grow, and evolve. As long as we are acting toward one of these loyalties, instead of abandoning them both, we are still abiding this virtue.\n\nLoyalty should also not be confused with duty. While things like oaths requires us to perform a job in a certain way that does not mean we are inherently loyal to those duties. A job might require someone to not indulge in alcohol, though that might not be a personal ideal that person is loyal to outside of their position and oaths. Above all else loyalty requires self-sacrifice. We are sometimes asked to put our loyalties before our personal gain, or we will be requires to set aside a grudge for the sake of loyalty to an ideal.\n\nLoyalty, while being the most straight forward ideal, lays the groundwork for the rest of the virtues, and can often guide us into each with a personal flare.\n\nUpcoming Events\nBe sure to look for these upcoming events.The Awakeners Picnic\nThe Sparkle Ball\nThe Fantasy Ball\n\n\nHistorical Queries\nHow familiar are you with the archives of the Chroniclers?

No matter the rank or gender you'll find something for you. While jewelry is used for many things, the major reason is to accessorize. Jewelry can make a huge difference with any outfit.\n\nIt can give you that pop you were missing to pull your outfit together as well as aiding to change a look from casual to formal. There's absolutely no reason not to upgrade up your look with jewelry. The best part about jewelry is that you can design it to your own personal style. Have fun with it and make a statement about your style.\n\nThis article will be a five-part series in which I will go over different ways to include jewelry with your outfit and how to correctly do so.\n\nWhat color is my outfit?\n\nThe color of your outfit is the second most important question when it comes to accessorizing. Many people make the mistake of just being too matchy-matchy. The color of your jewelry does not have to be the exact same color as your outfit or the other jewelry that you are wearing.Should your outfit be in shades of black, white or other neutrals, gems in any color look stylish and coordinated.\nIf your outfit is a little more colorful, make sure your gem colors don't clash.\nIf you're uncertain of what fits best you can either ask a jeweler or play the safe card. The safe card would be using gems and metals that go with everything. For gems, the best choices are crystals, silver-topaz, and diamonds. For metals pale-iron, steel, and silver are easy to work with.\n\n With that being said, do remember to order within your station. You may ask a jeweler if you are unsure. And always remember that fashion is art, so be sure to express yourself through that art and make each outfit from your own unique style.On the Importance of Hats\nWrit by Senior Seamstress, sera CalamityThere is nothing like a stylish hat to finish off an outfit. It is quite unfortunate that hats are not more popular amongst the Castle denizenry, for it has long been a custom in various cultures that hats be of particular importance.\n\nHattery, which is the art of hat crafting, has existed as a trade for as far back as any of us can remember, and was likely practiced even further in the past, though perhaps not with the same level of detail. It is a respectable skill, and one that even a woman can pursue with no issue. Along with learning how to design and make hats, you learn how to work with plumage, and the dyeing and arranging of feathers. Feathers are, of course, prized and very important, since many hats are not considered complete without at least one plume.\n\nHats have always been used to protect the head and keep it warm, since much heat is lost through the top of one's head; however, hats have also, for many ages, been status symbols and fashion statements. There is nothing like a hat to draw attention to the face and accent the finer features of it. They can be large, small, plain, or elaborate, and worn by both sexes, unlike many other garments. You can tell almost immediately what a person's occupation is by the hat they wear, whether they are intrinsically honored or not, rich or poor, prone to working or a member of the Court. A man of title or coin might wear a fancy damassin ribbon colored in ice-blue and embroidered in golden thread as a token from a member of the opposite sex or to keep his hair bound away from his face. A commoner female might wear a simple ebony headband of leather to insure stray tresses to do not fall into her face whilst working. Duelists wear cavalier hats with a lone white plume jutting out as a symbol of their Society and an indicator of their membership in it.\n\nFor women primarily hats are and have most often been a fashion accessory. Much effort and expense can go into the procuring of the 'perfect' hat, and it is by far one of the more important accessories an individual can own. There is an old saying that states 'If you want to get noticed or get ahead, then wear a hat, and make it count.' -- Yes, the pun is intended.\n\nHead coverings are not limited to fashion only and there is real etiquette involved in the wearing of one. A female of any class might be considered improperly dressed if they do not have something covering their head, especially considering the cold weather and snow. In some cultures, such as Eastern where Master Ali hails from, a woman might be in disgrace if she does not cover her head when out and about in public. Only the most poor amongst other cultures, or occasionally the peasants, went without head gear, and even then women often wore basic caps which have the added advantage of keeping ones hair clean and tidy. Due to the fact our garments are provided free for us out of Her Majesty's generosity, there is absolutely no reason nor excuse to not order a hat at your earliest convenience, and it is our greatest hope that after reading this article you shall.",

It is the virtue that gives us shape by determining who we are and what is important to us while granting a purpose. It is built upon the pillars of affection, sacrifice, and compassion, and rooted in sincerity, simplicity, and boldness of nature. As an ideal, it should not be a blind following or a routine expression of obedience, but rather a choice or series of choices made consciously and with a regard for the well-being of those involved.\n\nWhen we move to make a decision, loyalty requires that we must actively contemplate how it will affect those we are committed to -- how it will reflect on them, make them feel, or even how we would feel were the tables reversed. We then allow this consideration to influence our choices and guide us to the best possible outcome rather than thinking exclusively of ourselves and our own agendas. In this aspect, it is likened to charity in giving at our own expense to benefit another and show our devotion to them. This level of sacrifice can range from the simple allowance of their influence on our decisions to physically putting ourselves in harm's way to ensure their safety or prosperity..\n\nAs a virtue, loyalty does not tell us who or what we must have an attachment to, or how loyal we must feel to them or their ideas; it only tells us what it means to be loyal, and leaves the details of the rest for us to decide; thus, it is our duty to refine our personal sets of values and endeavor to stick by them, even when it isn't convenient to do so. At all times there are choices to be made, some easier than others, and we have to be able to quickly determine for ourselves what we hold most important and dear in those moments where black and white cease to exist.Upcoming EventsBe sure to look for these upcoming events.Handmaiden's Picnic: Avalonian Glade\nAn Evening of Music, 18thYRA\n\n Historical QueriesHow familiar are you with the archives of the Chroniclers?

          "text": "How to Accessorize with Jewelry; Part Three\nWrit by Lead Apprentice Jeweler, Mistress AdelineJewelry has been within this keep for years and is still one of the most active crafting guilds because it caters to everyone. No matter the rank or gender you'll find something for you. While jewelry is used for many things, the major reason is to accessorize. Jewelry can make a huge difference with any outfit. It can give you that pop you were missing to pull your outfit together as well as aiding to change a look from casual to formal. There's absolutely no reason not to upgrade up your look with jewelry. The best part about jewelry is that you can design it to your own personal style. Have fun with it and make a statement about your style.\n\nThis article will be a five-part series in which I will go over different ways to include jewelry with your outfit and how to correctly do so.\n\nWhat are my options?\n\nWhen you're deciding to order jewelry you must know what is available to you. This can be decided by checking the guidelines. Pieces, metal, gems, designs, and engravings are all decided on based on your rank and link. There is a wide selection for each rank so no one is left out and you still have a unique piece of jewelry like no one else. Please be advised that it would be unwise and disrespectful to order outside your rank. Not only does it show impatience, but it also can be seen as presumptuous, two things that would cause you a great disfavor with members of the Castle and the Jewelers.\n\nBe patient, enjoy the juicy fruits that are available for your rank! Such as the lovely crystal gem that ranks all across the board use because of its spectacular clear sparkle that at times resemble the diamond gem. If you need assistance that the guidelines cannot assist you with, contact a jeweler and we will make sure your jewelry needs are entirely satisfied.\n\nAlways remember that fashion is art, so be sure to express yourself through that art and make each outfit from your own unique style.Fashion For Beginners: The Order Form\nWrit by Junior Seamstress, Sera TaiteThe day we first awake in the castle, we are given a simple outfit and a cloak. As time goes on, you see all of the outfits of different styles and colors, and you decide that you want that, too. Nobody would blame you for wanting something better. In fact, ordering a new outfit is encouraged! Regardless of your rank and link, you can wear an outfit that is unlike any other. Your future fashion statement starts with an order form. These order forms can be found three floors up from the ground level, and all the way west of the bowling lounge. The ordering pad is just outside the Outer Bailey Clother's Room. If you Just tear the page off the pad, you are well on your way to ordering your first outfit. For those that have difficulty reading or writing, fear not! There are people around the castle who are more than willing to assist with helping you create an outfit. Just ask someone and they will lead you in the right direction.\n\nTo get started on the order form for your AMAZING outfit, we will need just a little information about you. Your name is a must. We will need to know who to send the outfit to when we are finished with it. You also add your hair color and your complexion as well as the other information as this helps us to determine the best colors that work with your current appearance. Next, you will need to know what materials you would like to use and what colors. It is suggested to use three of each with at least one color that is a shade of white, gray, black, neutral or brown, especially if you decide upon a leather or a fur. I will further discuss materials and colors at a later time.\n\nFinally, comes the fun part! You will want to decide upon the type of outfit that you would like to wear. What combination of clothing do you see yourself wearing? For seras, do you want to wear a dress or a skirt with a blouse and bodice? Sers, do you wish for something more formal like a doublet or slightly casual with a vest and shirt? Along with the types of materials the colors, the fits, and embroideries, the possibilities are endless.\n\nAfter the order form is complete (and signed), you will need to send your order form to an outer clothier. Those that are awake and accepting orders at this time are seras Trinity, Calamity and Taite. Please follow the guidelines when ordering. The guidelines for ordering clothing can be found on the public boards. Please order clothing, colors, and materials that are within your link and rank. If changes to your order need to be made, you will be notified before the outfit is made. You are not expected to be perfect. I've been making orders for some time, and I still make mistakes. (Thankfully, I have a patient teacher!!)\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, we look forward to seeing your completed order forms!Underappreciated Jewelry: How to Make Your Life Better, Part One\nWrit by Lead Apprentice Jeweler, sera KimberlyBed Warmers\n\nOne of the most wonderful things about Winter is the feeling of crawling into a cozy, warm bed. However, sometimes it takes a bit for your own warmth to permeate your blankets enough to be truly comfortable. Also, sometimes the harsher weather makes it seem as though you need thrice the blankets you have, and you toss and turn trying to warm up. This is where bed warmers come in!\n\nMost Denizens of Her Majesty's Castle spend more time sleeping than awake. Some sleep for moons, or even years at a time. Should we not take advantage of the Winter, and make our beds a Winter paradise?\n\nImagine, after a long day in the cold, slipping into a bed that is already plenty warm. Imagine not waking in the middle of your sleep because you need to grab a blanket. Imagine being perfectly warm and cozy from the moment you slip in to your covers, to the moment you wake. Using a bed warmer can also help to soothe sore muscles, as well as help relieve that nasty cough one gets after breathing too much cold air.\n\nAll Honored Guests and above may order a bed warmer directly from any Jeweler. Do not miss out on owning such a wonderful, useful, luxurious item.",

Just ask someone and they will lead you in the right direction.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>o get started on the order form for your AMAZING outfit, we will need just a little information about you. Your name is a must. We will need to know who to send the outfit to when we are finished with it. You also add your hair color and your complexion as well as the other information as this helps us to determine the best colors that work with your current appearance. Next, you will need to know what materials you would like to use and what colors. It is suggested to use three of each with at least one color that is a shade of white, gray, black, neutral or brown, especially if you decide upon a leather or a fur. I will further discuss materials and colors at a later time.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">F</span>inally, comes the fun part! You will want to decide upon the type of outfit that you would like to wear. What combination of clothing do you see yourself wearing? For seras, do you want to wear a dress or a skirt with a blouse and bodice? Sers, do you wish for something more formal like a doublet or slightly casual with a vest and shirt?

However, sometimes it takes a bit for your own warmth to permeate your blankets enough to be truly comfortable. Also, sometimes the harsher weather makes it seem as though you need thrice the blankets you have, and you toss and turn trying to warm up. This is where bed warmers come in!<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">M</span>ost Denizens of Her Majesty&apos;s Castle spend more time sleeping than awake. Some sleep for moons, or even years at a time. Should we not take advantage of the Winter, and make our beds a Winter paradise?<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">I</span>magine, after a long day in the cold, slipping into a bed that is already plenty warm. Imagine not waking in the middle of your sleep because you need to grab a blanket. Imagine being perfectly warm and cozy from the moment you slip in to your covers, to the moment you wake. Using a bed warmer can also help to soothe sore muscles, as well as help relieve that nasty cough one gets after breathing too much cold air.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">A</span>ll Honored Guests and above may order a bed warmer directly from any Jeweler.

          "text": "Creative Writing: The Top Four\nWrit by Senior Chronicler, sera YazminMany denizens believe that it is absolutely impossible to write a story that is fully and originally your own. I, however, disagree with this statement because stories are nothing more than one man's imagination becoming our literature entertainment. A thought, a dream, a doodle, a jest, these are all things that can start a story. All it takes is your mind, one small thing can easily be turned into a sixteen-page book or longer. So, in this article, I will list the top four things needed to write a good story in no specific order as each one is just as important as the last. To further delve into the process of writing, feel free to attend writing classes on Saturn's day at the sixth late bell.\n\nStep One: The title of the book is the best way to catch the attention of your audience. It has to be intriguing and inviting, something to make them want to open that book. Your book could be extremely amazing full of lots of jests, action, or romance, but if they do not take that first step to open it. Now, with that being said you do not always have to title your book at the beginning, because most times as you write the title you choose may end up not working or you may find a better title. However, if you've completed the entirety of the book and still lack a proper title, then this will assist you. I find it is easiest to find a title by reading my own working and looking for words that pop out such as surnames, towns, guilds, magic and so much more. These are all things that could make a great title or lead you down the path to making a great title. The major thing you want to avoid is using a title that is misleading, so look at it from an outsider. If you saw this book title, what would come to your mind first? Finally, use your friends and get their opinion on the title(s) you're considering or to even toss out some ideas after reading your book. These are all steps that can assist you in choosing a title.\n\nStep Two: The plot and first paragraph of your tale is key to making a great story. Now that you have the title, you need to strike it home with a good opening paragraph. It's similar to weapons for those of you who are fighters or even a dancer. The title is the build-up, and the paragraph is the attack or move that determines how the rest of the story will continue. Like dancing or fighting, do the wrong step or attack and the rest is usually downhill from there. So if you can create a first paragraph that steals their curiosity and clutches it for dear life, they will continue to read or listen to your story if only to satisfy their curiosity. Otherwise, they'll likely close the book and search for something else or just forget that whole reading business in general.\n\nStep Three: There are many things that help you as a writer create a character, however, for the sake of this article, I'll only go over a few. When creating a new character, the main key is to make sure that the character and their story feel real to the audience. Otherwise, they won't make a connection as easily and it more than likely will turn them away from your tale. To make this character a real person, you need to have a backstory for them even if you do not use it all in your tale, give them flaws because no character is perfect, give them a unique way of speaking this can be from their demeanor or an accent, and making your you understand their beliefs, likes and dislikes. Once you have all of these, you could easily speak about this character as if they are a friend or enemy you've known your entire life. Furthermore, remember to add the following to each character:Role: What purpose does he or she serve in this story? Are they a follower or a leader? Describe to us why this person is here and why they have this role, it should be connected to their strengths and weaknesses.\nMotivation: Each character is driven for some reason or another. If your character is the antagonist of the story, explain what motivates him or her to do what they do. Why is this person the antagonist in your tale as opposed to another character? Love, hate, greed? Focus on this and it will make them realistic.\nLife Experiences: This is very closely tied to the second, this will help you break down why they are the way they are. This is needed and should be thoroughly detailed to fully have a realistic character.\nStrengths/Weaknesses: This has been explained a little in flaws, no one wants a perfect character who never has any down moment because life is not always perfect. However, at the same time, you should not have a character that has no strong points at all. I like to balance mine out to give them equal strengths and weakness to bring life to my characters.\n\n Step Four: You simply cannot have a book without some form of conflict, because it brings life to the tale and makes it interesting. Otherwise, you are just writing about a perfect life that none of us will ever have because life is simply not perfect. Conflict is almost always a disagreement between two characters, also known as the protagonist and the antagonist. However, conflict is not always just between two people. You can have many types of conflicts within your book which I'll list below. Conflict is hard and it forces your characters to act and get out of their comfort zone. How will each character react, will they fight back or succumb to the antagonist. Conflict helps the readers really understand who your characters are when faced with hard decisions. It's why I enjoy when characters are smacked in the face with heavy conflict, the worse the conflict the better the story.\n\nTypes of Conflict:Character Conflict with Other Characters\nCharacter Conflict with Nature\nSelf Character Conflict\nSociety Character Conflict\nMystical Character Conflict\n\n In closing, write what you know! Otherwise it comes off as unrealistic and ignorant.There are so many ways to use what you know to make a great conflict and in the end, it will be relatable in some way.Poems For the Royal Family\nWrit by seras Aleysia and EloraShe who called to us from the dark\nAnd bids us new life\nWe gladly lift our voice in thanks.\n\nShe who sees our potential\nBids us rise above\nTo leave our pasts behind us\n\nEach day we toil, in Her name\nWe live to serve Her\nVivienne, Long May She Reign.\n\n~ Sera AleysiaSuch splendor as you might expect\nYet so much more than eyes detect\nIn beauty our Queen worthy reigns\nTender heart but wiser she remains\n\nHis Excellency a weight doth carry\nHis love and duty to she he tarrys\nEyes filled with love and devotion\nHe whispers his heart at her motion\n\nHis Highness regally doth he inspire\nGently rescues the weak from evils fire\nPowerful though he still shall be\nHis love is clear for Her Majesty\n\n~ Sera EloraUpcoming EventsBe sure to look for these upcoming events.The Outer Bailey Library's Hero Ball\nHer Majesty's Royal Court\nWedding and Reception of Kamilah and Elesin\n\n Historical QueriesHow familiar are you with the archives of the Chroniclers?

Below are just a snippet of some of our newest books\nBad Poetry, 19YRA\nWrit by Mistress Brook Toustain\nListen to me right now. I love her. Who is she?\nOh verily, verily you ask and I am going to tell you\nAbout her whomst I love love love love love love\nHair: a skein of yarn dangling from the pretty loom\nThat is also her head\nIf her head was bigger and did things for stuff\nLike a loom does?\nYou know I am not really sure I have seen one\nVerily, verily, and a hey-nonny but\nI have seen yarn and her hair is kind of like that\nTirra lirra, I see her coming up the stairs now\nShe caught me unawares now\nI barely made it to my chair now\nI quite fancy some pears now\nOh no but I didn't forget about her hairs now\nOh my loom-headed love, my loom-headed love\nPlease lend me a silver for the toy machine\nBecause I want to win a crab\nCombat with the Sword and Shield\nWrit by Mistress Josie Brennan\nWe only use one arm to fight with when wielding a shortsword, so we can cut or thrust from any angle, unlike the longsword which requires both hands on the hilt, necessitating that we use a much more complex series of stances, but the sword-shield style is the opposite. You lead with your left leg, because the shield should be in front of the sword, and then stab and cut around the shield, with the shield always before you. On the battlefield, there can be no doubt, the protection of a shield against projectiles or flanking by multiple opponents is too invaluable to pass up. Normally formations without shields are only used in specialist roles. For example, zweihanders, two-handed great swords, are usually used on the battlefield specifically to break up pike formations. Halberds are used chiefly to counter cavalry. But you'll rarely see an army employ these types of units in large ratios because they are only really effective at what they specialize in - to any other unit formation, they are vulnerable.\nFar Away Tales\nWrit by sera Meryl\nAngling the mirror just-so, Uzume overturned the tub, and stepped upon it, and began to dance. Her footfalls were fast and furious, and the tub acted as a drum, and let out great booms of sound, and the gods and goddesses around her began to smile. Heartened by this, she gathered the edges of her kimono upward, tearing her robes away from her body in a frenzied state. The chuckles became laughter which grew and grew, for as she danced, she had no shame, her determination to create a ruckus spreading joy to all who gathered. Ameterasu heard the din, first, the drum beats like a kicking heart, and then the chuckling, which became a roar through the cave. Annoyed by the interruption to her mourning, she frowned and crept closer and closer to the entrance of her cave, determined to see what all the fuss was about. As the light of her body left the cave in a small sliver, it hit the mirror just-so. A warmth spread over the assembled masses, and Uzume continued her fevered dance, and the laughter grew and grew. Curious as to the warm, Amaterasu dared to peek out of her cave entirely and was stunned and blinded by the light of the mirror, and the joy of the many gods and goddesses before her. Before she could turn around, Tajikarao, one of the many gods there, hefted a huge rock before the entrance of her cave, and foiled her escape back into the darkness, sealing it with holy energy. Uzume was lifted then, not as a handmaiden, but to become the goddess of revelry, mirth, and the Dawn, and Amaterasu rejoined the heavens once more, and Daylight returned to the land once more.\nField Medicine\nWrit by sera Juliee\nWhen it comes to caring for patients in a serious event, it is best to assess what patient's needs are, what personnel you have available and what resources to deploy and where. This is a good time to utilize the knowledge you gained from the previous chapter. The best way to proceed is to group your patients. Walking wounded and minor wounded can wait for assistance. Provide them with field bandages and towels to stop the bleeding until you have the ability to see to them. Their injuries are minor and non-life threatening. They may need gentle reminding of this. Unfortunately, this means your efforts need to be focused between the gravely wounded and seriously wounded. Ultimately, your priorities should be with who you believe will survive.\nThe Book Hunt, 19thYRA\nWrit by Lady Charmiam and Mistresses Brook and Adeline\nRiddle Three:\n\nWash with no water\nKnives flash\nTrees weep\nWater turns to bone\n\n- Lady Charmiam\nThe Honor Virtues, An Outside Perspective\nWrit by sera Vasilisa\nPresently we as a whole know the general meaning of Honesty, however, the virtue meaning of Honesty is substantially more vast than simply your truth. Honesty is likewise akin to Valor. I say this because when you stand up for your beliefs, you are essentially informing the world which side you remain on in any circumstance and in addition keeping the bond that you gave. Being honest demonstrates that you are a credible individual, an individual that others will trust in as well as listen to you when you have something to say. It enables you to recognize your limitations and weaknesses without any false pretenses, which is a shortcoming that many have. Knowing who you are inside and out with regards to the good, bad, and the ugly is an essential piece of your honor. It will make you a reliable partner to have around, a great warrior to battle alongside, or essentially an incredible individual and/or companion.\nThe Innkeeper's Daughter\nWrit by Euphelia Noronos\n'The Prince will be here tonight,' a red-headed soldier, Malloy, said. At first, Fionna thought she had misheard him since the bearded, craggy-faced man spoke through a mouth crammed full of toast, egg, and bacon. 'Tonight? Has he finished with the west quadrant, then?' A slender, sly-faced man whose name Fionna had never learned, asked. Malloy nodded, and Fionna picked up the platter, skittering away. The Prince would be here? Did they mean back in the city? Or here, the Wicked Wasp? Why would he come to this Inn when there were so many nicer ones in the city? The Wasp was a lower-end travelers' inn, catering to locals with cheap beer and traveling minstrels. Those thoughts churned through Fionna's head as Cook restocked the platter to its heaping heights, and all through the journey from the kitchen to the common room. This time, the platter went to another table of newly woken officers, to be decimated in much the same way. There was no talk of Prince Natahn there, though. Even as Fionna realized her curiosity was dangerous, she mentally chided herself for being foolish. What exactly would she do with the information? It wasn't like she could kill the invading Prince, or even get the news to anyone handy. It was dangerous to know what she now knew if what she knew meant the Prince would eat at one of the Wasp's rough trestles that night.",

          "text": "How to Accessorize with Jewelry; Part Four\nWrit by Lead Apprentice Jeweler, Mistress Adeline\n\nJewelry has been within this keep for years and is still one of the most active crafting guilds because it caters to everyone. No matter the rank or gender you'll find something for you. While jewelry is used for many things, the major reason is to accessorize. Jewelry can make a huge difference with any outfit. It can give you that pop you were missing to pull your outfit together as well as aiding to change a look from casual to formal. There's absolutely no reason not to upgrade up your look with jewelry. The best part about jewelry is that you can design it to your own personal style. Have fun with it and make a statement about your style. This article will be a five-part series in which I will go over different ways to include jewelry with your outfit and how to correctly do so.\nWhat Kind Of Outfit Am I Wearing\n\nWhile this may sound similar to the first question, I assure you it is not the same at all. There are questions you have to ask yourself, such as does your outfit have embroidery or is it a little more simple? Are the details in different colors? Is the outfit casual or formal? Outfits with embroideries and a lot of detail don't need too much jewelry. A bracelet and a simple pair of stud earrings will pull together any outfit without making it look tacky. If your outfit is lacking embroidery, you can use jewelry as your bold statement. For example, a navy gown with a garnet and bronze drape necklace. This would really give the gown a colorful pop without going too overboard. Other clothing in red shades can be added to accent the outfit. To summarize, when you have a busy outfit wear smaller and more simple jewelry and while wearing colorful clothing, try not to match too much. Less is more!\n\nFashion for Beginners: Colors\nWrit by Senior Seamstress, Sera Taite\nCreating an outfit is fun, but can also be stressful at the same time. You want to show people who you are, but yet, be appropriate enough in case there�s a chance that you are greeted by Queen Vivienne. Of course, if this were to happen, the last thing you would think about is your clothing. You would be more focused on remembering how to speak or how to keep your balance. We may not be greeted by Queen Vivienne until moons, perhaps years, later, but when encountering people of stature, what we wear is part of the first impression that we give off. If each article of clothing that you wear is a different color, you might not be giving the good first impression that you were hoping for. If you are looking through the list of colors, and you wrinkle your nose at sage, chances are, this color will not be the main color of your outfit. Choose a color that stands out to you. Your main color will be part of the outfit that shows the most. For my outfits, the main color is used for the gowns or the bellcloaks. The other colors that you choose will compliment your main color. Feel free to look through the list of colors and figure out what colors work best with your main color. Next, I will explain some of the guidelines. Everyone is expected to wear clothing, colors, and materials that are within their rank and link unless given prior authorization. If someone were to give you an outfit that is above your rank and link for an event, that outfit can be worn to that event only. When you order, make sure you follow the guidelines and choose colors that are within your rank and link at the time of ordering.\n\nColors can be added or taken off the list at the Crown�s discretion. When this happens, there will be a notice on the board. This is a reminder for all people who have awaken after a deep sleep. Please check your clothing. If you wear clothing of a rank or link that is higher than what you are now because of loss of titles or station, please remove them and wear something that is suitable to wear based on these new changes. If you have nothing that is of proper rank or link, please order an outfit, and in the notes, let us know that you have awakened and are in need of an outfit, so we can process the order quickly. If anyone should have any questions or concerns regarding colors, please seek out a clothier. Most of the information regarding colors that you need to know are found on the public boards, and please be sure to read the guidelines before ordering.\n\nBanned colors are colors that are...banned. You will not be allowed to order or wear these colors. These colors are chosen by the crown. The colors that are currently on the banned list, are: aqua, canary, cardinal, carnation, dusky rose, green, lilac, orchid, periwinkle, pink, primrose, red, rose, scarlet, sapphire, silvery-lilac, yellow and orange.\n\nSumptuary colors are colors that are banned for those that are not of rank or link to wear the colors.

No matter the rank or gender you&apos;ll find something for you. While jewelry is used for many things, the major reason is to accessorize. Jewelry can make a huge difference with any outfit. It can give you that pop you were missing to pull your outfit together as well as aiding to change a look from casual to formal. There&apos;s absolutely no reason not to upgrade up your look with jewelry. The best part about jewelry is that you can design it to your own personal style. Have fun with it and make a statement about your style. This article will be a five-part series in which I will go over different ways to include jewelry with your outfit and how to correctly do so.</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>hat Kind Of Outfit Am I Wearing<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>hile this may sound similar to the first question, I assure you it is not the same at all. There are questions you have to ask yourself, such as does your outfit have embroidery or is it a little more simple? Are the details in different colors? Is the outfit casual or formal? Outfits with embroideries and a lot of detail don&apos;t need too much jewelry. A bracelet and a simple pair of stud earrings will pull together any outfit without making it look tacky. If your outfit is lacking embroidery, you can use jewelry as your bold statement. For example, a navy gown with a garnet and bronze drape necklace. This would really give the gown a colorful pop without going too overboard. Other clothing in red shades can be added to accent the outfit. To summarize, when you have a busy outfit wear smaller and more simple jewelry and while wearing colorful clothing, try not to match too much. Less is more!</div><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:48px\">F</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">ashion for Beginners: Colors</span><br>\n<i>Writ by Senior Seamstress, Sera Taite</i><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">C</span>reating an outfit is fun, but can also be stressful at the same time. You want to show people who you are, but yet, be appropriate enough in case there&#xFFFD;s a chance that you are greeted by Queen Vivienne. Of course, if this were to happen, the last thing you would think about is your clothing. You would be more focused on remembering how to speak or how to keep your balance. We may not be greeted by Queen Vivienne until moons, perhaps years, later, but when encountering people of stature, what we wear is part of the first impression that we give off. If each article of clothing that you wear is a different color, you might not be giving the good first impression that you were hoping for. If you are looking through the list of colors, and you wrinkle your nose at sage, chances are, this color will not be the main color of your outfit. Choose a color that stands out to you. Your main color will be part of the outfit that shows the most. For my outfits, the main color is used for the gowns or the bellcloaks. The other colors that you choose will compliment your main color. Feel free to look through the list of colors and figure out what colors work best with your main color. Next, I will explain some of the guidelines. Everyone is expected to wear clothing, colors, and materials that are within their rank and link unless given prior authorization. If someone were to give you an outfit that is above your rank and link for an event, that outfit can be worn to that event only. When you order, make sure you follow the guidelines and choose colors that are within your rank and link at the time of ordering.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">C</span>olors can be added or taken off the list at the Crown&#xFFFD;s discretion. When this happens, there will be a notice on the board. This is a reminder for all people who have awaken after a deep sleep. Please check your clothing. If you wear clothing of a rank or link that is higher than what you are now because of loss of titles or station, please remove them and wear something that is suitable to wear based on these new changes. If you have nothing that is of proper rank or link, please order an outfit, and in the notes, let us know that you have awakened and are in need of an outfit, so we can process the order quickly. If anyone should have any questions or concerns regarding colors, please seek out a clothier. Most of the information regarding colors that you need to know are found on the public boards, and please be sure to read the guidelines before ordering.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">B</span>anned colors are colors that are...banned. You will not be allowed to order or wear these colors. These colors are chosen by the crown. The colors that are currently on the banned list, are: aqua, canary, cardinal, carnation, dusky rose, green, lilac, orchid, periwinkle, pink, primrose, red, rose, scarlet, sapphire, silvery-lilac, yellow and orange.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">S</span>umptuary colors are colors that are banned for those that are not of rank or link to wear the colors. Wearing these colors without being of proper link and rank will result in being visited by a member of the Royal Army. It is important that if you are in possession of these garments and are not of link and rank, do not wear them.

          "text": "Castle Announcements and Past Events\n\nThe Hand of Five,Attacks, Kidnappings, and Defeat is just a quick summary of what happened when the blue wraith from the Hand of Five came back to spread his terror. Older guests immediately knew he was coming after feeling his telltale cold and fearful magical grip that randomly took hold denizens over a course of three days. It began with just feelings, but over time he took it a step further by kidnapping denizens. A total of eight denizens were taken, Lady Charmiam, Mistresses Josie and Juliana, sers Kaspar and Morgenstern, and seras Alyndra, Kona, and Pruul, who lives in the Under Bailey. With the combined efforts of the Army, Faith, and Sorcerers, the eight were all retrieved. The blue wraith was temporarily destroyed and his focus was taken. More thorough information can be found in the chronicler's section on the public boards.\nThe Hunting Grounds,In honor of His Royal Highness, Her Majesty has created the Hunting Grounds located in the south area of the Royal Gardens through the bronze arch. This place is specifically for members of the Winter Court and is a replica of place within His Highness's dreams. Inside, the Winter Court will find a picnic area, a vast forest, and a merchant. The forest area has varied bushes and vines that you can harvest from to gain special berries of bronze, silver, and rare gold as well as normal edible berries and flowers. The special berries can then be traded with the merchant to buy in theme items such as items for hunting. It is believed that enjoying the Hunting Grounds will aid in His Highness's health. A more detailed chronicle can be found on the public boards.\nCircus of Dreams,Held in conjunction with the Winter Ball, sera Taite gave four days of fun for the outer denizens that were unable to attend the Winter Ball. This included games, contests, face painting, dancing ribbons, and much more. Seras Auriela, Calamity, Diana, Kona, and Tine assisted her by hosting events for the circus. Sera Taite plans to go bigger and better for next year.\nThe Winter Ball,The Winter Ball is one of the most highly anticipated events in the Inner Bailey. This year it was held by the Mistress of Entertainments, Mistress Josie. She took a classic masquerade theme and put her twist on it. With the help from own Lady Sinvy, the Embinders, Jewelers, Clothiers, and Cooks, Mistress Josie put together a Winter Ball people will likely not forget. The masks gave a thrill to the event and the custom gifts of dye, wine, and jewelry will forever last as a testament to her hard work.\nSera Taite's Sculptures,Since waking, sera Taite has been known for constantly trying new things when it comes to sculpting. She has so far mastered snow, wood, and clay, with stone soon to come. So it was no real surprise to see her do a lecture within that family. In the final week of the first moon members of both baileys came out to support Taite as she showed off her sculptures and explained how she made them. One of the most talked about pieces was the bust of Lady Charmiam, which sera Taite made by her own hand in clay.\nAwakeners Ardor Festival,If you live in the Outer Bailey and didn't attend the Ardor Festival, you must have been deep in sleep as it was almost impossible to miss it. The Awakeners brought back the annual Ardor Festival which is a large castle event that is spread out usually through the weekend or an entire week depending on the host. This year on the third day of the second moon, the festivities went on for consecutive seven days. The events included dance classes, games, crafting bells, contests and much more that ended with a grand Ball. A full break down of each day can be found in chroniclers section in the Lecture Hall.\nOpen PositionsThe Herald wishes to provide the castle residents with a list of currently-open positions amongst the available groups and guilds. If you wish to publish an opening within your own guild or group, please send a missive to any currently-active Chronicler with a three-sentence description of the position, a short list of requirements, and whom to contact for more details.\n\nThe Royal Heralds Applications\nWrit by Senior Herald, Mistress Juliana\n\nHeraldry is the practice of devising, granting, displaying, describing, and recording coats of arms and heraldic badges. Heralds and Pursuivants research, practice and design heraldry, though it is not exclusive as Knights and Nobles are also well-versed and schooled in the language of Heraldry.\nThe emergence of heraldry is linked distinguishing Royalty, Nobility, and Chivalry quickly and easily, either while in combat, during Court or other important and formal venues. Distinguishing devices were used on surcoats (\"coats of arms\"), upon shields, and even upon war horses. At first, the formal system of rules for heraldry was simple, but have developed into an ever more complex form to ensure that each Coat of Arms is unique and distinguishable.\nTo learn more about Heraldry, the Members of Court and Honored Guests invited to attend lectures in the Royal Heralds Office once a week, as posted on the boards. If you wish to join this illustrious group, you may send your application to Mistress Juliana.\nThe Royal Treasury Applications\nWrit by the Mistress of Coin, Mistress Adeline\n\nThe Royal Treasury is once again seeking two new denizens to join our prestigious royal office. There are positions open for denizens of any rank who are courteous, intelligent, diligent, and well-spoken. You will be working directly with Her Majesty's Winter Court and starting off at the tenth link on the Chain of Being.\n\nIf you are interested in a career serving Her Majesty through the Treasury, please contact sera Auriela for more information or see the application on the public boards. Please be aware that those beneath honored guests may require letters of recommendation. Thank you, and have a grand day!\nThe Royal Collegium Applications\nWrit by the Dean of the Collegium, Lady Charmiam\n\nThe four colleges of the Royal Collegium are the College of Humanities, the College of Combat, the College of Logics and the College of Philosophy.\nWe are currently accepting applications for all four colleges.

The Office's main duties are to record history as it unfolds, whether it be a daily happening or a one-of-a-kind magical occurrence.

The Office&apos;s main duties are to record history as it unfolds, whether it be a daily happening or a one-of-a-kind magical occurrence. By doing so, we inform the denizenry and aristocracy of events they were not able to witness while providing a reference for future generations of awakened guests. It is one of the castle&apos;s oldest institutions and among the most vital. To join, describe a witnessed event in the form of a chronicle and send it to a current active Senior or Court Chronicler (examples of chronicles can be found in the Lecture Hall). Attending open bells will better your chances of being accepted into the Office.</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>he benefits of becoming a Chronicler:</div></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Your work will be available for all members of the castle to read, including Royals.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">You will be given constant aid and guidance to better your writing.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Each chronicle written gains you coin from the Treasury.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Your name will appear on the Chain of Being.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Senior chroniclers now gain bonus benefits from the Chambers</span></li>\n</ul>"

Also present were ser Sagen and a calico cat which mewed sadly for what just transpired.\n\nSinvy's face was streaked with blood and tears. In her hands was a bronze stiletto which she sheathed quickly.\n\nThe Page had just seen the death of one ser Rathe, a Rememberer. She had unsuccessfully tried to staunch the bleeding of his wounds by cauterizing them with her heated stiletto. No nurse arrived in time to treat him.\n\nFor the record, sera Sinvy is an honored guest with rights to have a stiletto. She is not a trained nurse.\n\nIt was reported Rathe had been gravely wounded by a ghost in the Lecture Hall of the Outer Bailey, which also serves as the Outer Bailey Library.\n\nSera Lanelle was present when the spirit attacked Rathe. She went to fetch aid, but after being carried to the Refectory fireplace and treatment attempted, he died from the ghastly wounds inflicted by the dark and incorporeal monstrosity.\n\nChronicler Arian, who was waiting to see the Lord Chamberlain outside his office, reported about midnight, \"Apparently three people, two sers and a sera --- I could not identify them --- dragged him [Rathe] from the south of the main corridor where I was waiting for His Lordship.\"\n\nThe Chronicler reported they were apparently taking direction from a calico cat, who had somehow told them where Rathe could be found.\n\nHowever, sera Lanelle, eyewitness to the attack, did not say anything about a talking cat, and could not recall that the cat had spoken.\n\nShe said Rathe had been set upon \"by a malicious spirit.\"\n\nShe blamed herself in a way for not being able to save Rathe's life. With a haunted expression in her eyes, she said, \"It is my fault he died... I couldnt find help fast enough.\"\n\nWatchman Frell admitted the Watch was powerless to stop such creatures, and not authorized to protect the Queen's people from such horrors. He referred this reporter to speak with the Keepers.\n\nWhen asked about what the Winter Watch could do, he stated, \"that in itself is limited, as this spirit is nae known to be made of flesh and blood... Where [it if was] we may restrain him and take him into the dungeons.\"\n\nThis reporter recalls an earlier incident in the death of two other guests, ser Jeffery and sera Kalli, by ghostly attack. They were carved as if a butcher had taken a long drawing knife to their flesh. The rituals of Acolytes and the meditations of Rememberers were powerless to prevent their later deaths. While ser Jeffery returned after being slain by the dark spirit, sera Kalli either submitted to the dark spirit's deathly grip or remains in her room for some other unknown reason.\n\nThe Watchman offered his opinion about the risks of spirit attacks against anyone: \"Ghosts are a peril to all.\"\n\nWhen asked about the ghost's motive, the Watchman related the following story, \"Alas, all I know is that a spirit hath been attacking the Rememberers. And I suppose ser Rathe is the same spirit's recent victim. There is supposedly a story amoungst them stating that the founder's of the Rememberer's wife hath came upon the\nRememberers to warn them of a oncoming shadow.\"\n\nHe further clarified, \"The Spirit of the Founder's Wife hath come to warn the Rememberers of a Dark Spirit. I believe that Spirit is responsible for the known attacks on the rememberers up to this point. Ser Rathe, being the most recent victim.\"\n\nWhen asked whether this recent spirit was the same as the one which had slain Jeffery and Kalli, the Watchman did not reply with a certain answer. It should be noted that neither Jeffery nor Kalli are Rememberers.\n\nBoth Senior Rememberer Sagen and sera Lanelle were circumspect about specific details, both referring this reported to speak to ser Gareth, another Senior Rememberer.\n\nSera Lanelle said, \"I'm not really at liberty to say more about it... You should ask Gareth... it would be his decision to say what and who [should be told] about the spirit.\"\n\nWhy the Rememberers would wish to keep this risk to the public secret, what relation this spirit has to the one that savaged and killed Jeffery and Kalli, and what threat this ghost (or ghosts) poses to other people of the castle is unknown at this time.\n\nRememberers, Keepers of the Unveiled, and other parties who know the true origin and danger of these ghostly attackers are requested to contact this reporter.\n\nIf and as more facts are discovered, expect a future issue of the Tribune to inform you, the people of the Castle.",

He was in pain, the greatest of which was the setting of his leg by the nurse.\n\nThe grey-haired, bearded man bore a cane and also carried a cigar. He wore an ivory brocade sash and had a tan scabbard.\n\nIt was told to this reporter that he keeps a practice sword in his scabbard.\n\nHe was able to stand after having his knee set by use of the cane. The nurse said that the cane \"was a relic from his last life.\"\n\nWhen questioned about how he broke his knee, he led the reporter to the south stairs. There, on the steps just a few feet above the bottom of the stairwell was a beer mug.\n\nIn a re-creation according to the man, he showed how he stepped down, and suddenly the beer mug was rolled under his feet. When asked whether someone rolled the beer mug under his feet, he laughed and replied that yes, that's what happened. So it was all an accident apparently.\n\nUpon questioning other witnesses, it turned out that this man's name was actually Shadust, who had been a member of the Red Sashes. His sash, like his cane, is from his last life, before his crimes and beheading. \n\nRed Sash member Adayne allegedly has ordered others to not tell Shadust who he is. Why he is claiming to be Jespin could be because of a deception being perpetrated upon him, or it could be that he is quite aware of his past, and is assuming an identity to prevent unwanted attention.\n\nHe seemed to harbor a grudge against the Winter Watch, accusing this reporter of being a \"Weasel Pup.\"\n\nAfter showing this reporter how he slipped down the steps in a rather slow, laborious, yet utterly unclear re-enactment of events, he hobbled away with his cane, not identifying who it might have been to have thrown the beer mug under his feet, and without answering whether it was purposeful or accidental.\n\nThough he was in pain, Shadust kept up good spirits generally, smiling and making small-talk with those around him until he departed. \n\nThis reporter is quite interested in hearing from other parties involved in this story to get the unadulterated and complete truth of the story.",

He wore an ivory brocade sash and had a tan scabbard.<br>\n<br>\nIt was told to this reporter that he keeps a practice sword in his scabbard.<br>\n<br>\nHe was able to stand after having his knee set by use of the cane. The nurse said that the cane &quot;was a relic from his last life.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nWhen questioned about how he broke his knee, he led the reporter to the south stairs. There, on the steps just a few feet above the bottom of the stairwell was a beer mug.<br>\n<br>\nIn a re-creation according to the man, he showed how he stepped down, and suddenly the beer mug was rolled under his feet. When asked whether someone rolled the beer mug under his feet, he laughed and replied that yes, that&apos;s what happened. So it was all an accident apparently.<br>\n<br>\nUpon questioning other witnesses, it turned out that this man&apos;s name was actually Shadust, who had been a member of the Red Sashes. His sash, like his cane, is from his last life, before his crimes and beheading. <br>\n<br>\nRed Sash member Adayne allegedly has ordered others to not tell Shadust who he is. Why he is claiming to be Jespin could be because of a deception being perpetrated upon him, or it could be that he is quite aware of his past, and is assuming an identity to prevent unwanted attention.<br>\n<br>\nHe seemed to harbor a grudge against the Winter Watch, accusing this reporter of being a &quot;Weasel Pup.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nAfter showing this reporter how he slipped down the steps in a rather slow, laborious, yet utterly unclear re-enactment of events, he hobbled away with his cane, not identifying who it might have been to have thrown the beer mug under his feet, and without answering whether it was purposeful or accidental.<br>\n<br>\nThough he was in pain, Shadust kept up good spirits generally, smiling and making small-talk with those around him until he departed. <br>\n<br>\nThis reporter is quite interested in hearing from other parties involved in this story to get the unadulterated and complete truth of the story."

          "text": "TRIACURS TRIBUNE * I PRINT THE TRUTH\n\nIssue 1, Number 6\n\nLord Boreas, Lord Chancellor responsible for the upkeep of law, Winter Knight, and Royal Consort, personally and directly passed down orders to have Lance Zablan illegally arrested due to a fit of royal pique on trumped-up charges.\n\nLance Zablan was also punitively ordered by the Lord Chancellor to be ejected from his positions in Outer Bailey organizations such as the Awakeners and Carpenters.\n\nLance Zablan's \"crime?\" He found a mattress left out long after the conclusion of the Knight's Challenge in the basement of the Inner Bailey.\n\nThose responsible parties charged with keeping the secret of the age-old ritual of testing candidates for knighthood blundered. To cover up the event, Lance Zablan was arrested and is being held in the dungeons in a show of royal pique and petty resolve to cover up any embarrassing truths.\n\nThis magical mattress had the strange property of entrapping anyone who laid down upon it. Through a series of farcical misadventures, a number of people were caught in a room hidden within a magical tapestry, and were only released after being shaken down by a magical knight, Dame Or.\n\nTheir personal effects were returned to them in time.\n\nThis sort of enchantment against their will, intimidation and fleecing of many denizens could have constituted a crime in certain circumstances for any other subject of the crown, such as if a commoner had perpetrated the acts. But not even a public apology was offered nor criminal investigation launched.\n\nInstead, Lance Zablan was scapegoated and charged with three crimes: stealing Her Majesty's property, destroying Her Majesty's property, and disobeying Lord Boreas.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the charges, a Deputy of the Winter Watch gave this response, \"I don't feel it prudent to share Watch files, or Guard files with anyone outside of Royal Army.\"\n\nAnother source gave this answer. (The Tribune will withhold all names of helpful parties to prevent them from suffering royal displeasure.) \"Theft, Offense to the Crown...I would imagine. What the final charges would be, I don't know. It was at the order of the Lord Chancellor, as I have been told.\"\n\nThe accusations are ludicrous but show the kind of depths to which those in power within the castle are capable of sinking.\n\nIt was the mattress that ate people.\n\nLance had indeed carried the mattress away from where he found it, but to have it identified or explained after sera Elvii had laid upon it. But rather than find any of the forces of law or sorcery, he encountered other simple subjects who, through curiosity, became entrapped themselves.\n\nIf looked at through rational eyes, the \"theft\" was a case of someone trying to make sense of a chaotic situation, not a purposeful attempt to wrongfully take property for personal gain.\n\nLance is, or was until this arrest and ouster, one of the carpenters of the castle. They are normally allowed to carry furniture where it needs to go, and to repossess it from others at will with broad jurisdiction. No where was there mention made to him that this particular mattress was to remain where it was. Wherever this mattress came from, it was not properly recorded in the ledgers. And it seemed cursed.\n\nAccording to a source, which the Tribune will keep anonymous to protect from persecution, \"The general charge is that he took the mattress to his room, and therefore was stealing Her Majesty's property. He maintains that he blew his duckcall several times and waited with the mattress for bells, but eventually he had to move it so that a servant wouldn't pick it up. -- It was the mattress that ate people.\"\n\nWhy would a thief have blown a duckcall to summon the Royal Army if he had meant to unlawfully abscond with the mattress?\n\nThe \"crime\" of \"destruction of property\" is not even in the Capitulary of Law. While this could have been a euphamism or have stood in place of other crimes, one would have thought that the man most responsible for the upholding of law in the castle -- Lord Boreas -- would have actually cited a section of the Capitulary to make a proper accusation. As it is, this is an improper if not outright false accusation and should be dropped. The unspecific nature of the allegation makes it impossible to defend against. \n\nMoreover, according to the Tribune's sources, \"He didn't actually destroy anything, though.\"\n\nWhat he did do, which is disputedly a crime, was carry the mattress to prevent it from being carried off mysteriously by servants. He prevented its destruction as trash by other well-meaning servants. But by doing so, one witness reported \"...I had heard he brought it to a public place and another three or four people were trapped within. -- There is a Chronicle  on it.\"\n\nThe Tribune questioned one source, \"So in your opinion, if someone accused Lance of destruction of property involving this affair, would that sound like a trumped-up charge to you?\"\n\n\"It would,\" was the firm reply, \"Since the property is still in existence.\"\n\nLastly, since Lance Zablan was not under the direct command of Lord Boreas as a carpenter or as a Collector of Taxes the charge of disobeying a superior is not applicable. Moreover, Lance had never been given a direct or indirect order by Lord Boreas, so there was no order to disobey. This is simply and directly a trumped-up charge.\n\nHad it been insult to Lord Boreas, at least this kind of petty vindictiveness would have been legal. But since Lance is not a direct report to Lord Boreas, this was simply illegal icing on the already bitter cake.\n\nWhat was the real reason for Lance's arrest?\n\n\"I suspect though that Lance's problem runs deeper than just simple theft or mischief. The secrets of the Knight's Challenge are closely held.\"\n\nHowever, Lance was not a part of the Knight's Challenge. Whatever rules were put in place for the privacy of its conduct were not communicated to the populace at large.\n\nIn response to such allegations, Lance was adamant in maintaining his defense and innocence, but reasonable in allowing himself to suffer wrongful arrest:\n\n\"(Watchwoman) Devona tried to arrest him yesterday, and they ended up dueling. Him with a broken sword hilt. He won, but it didn't hurt her. He said he wanted to get his affairs in order as regards to Elvii and he'd meet her at twelve late bells, but she didn't accept and he walked away.\"\n\nLance had been planning to marry sera Elvii, but now stands accused of various \"crimes\" -- at least one of which, \"disobeying an order\" -- can keep him jailed indefinitely, at the Lord Chancellor's whim.\n\nThe subjects of this castle often hear about corruption and complain of it, and wonder why their voices are not listened to.\n\nMany in the castle are going to simply shrug off this event. Lance Zablan is not a popular person. He has made many enemies over the years. Was this simply an excuse to suspend the proceedings of law and apply arbitrary justice against him?\n\nThe Tribune and its publisher may likely fall under \"legal\" sanction and repression for its reporting of this event, but this will not prevent the Tribune from performing its duty, which is to present to you, the subjects of Her Majesty, from knowing the events of the castle, and the reasons behind them.\n\nFinally a question to you, the people of Castle Marrach:\n\nDo you believe Lance Zablan is being illegally framed for crimes by the Lord Chancellor simply to hide an embarrassing situation?",

I suggest people look in the mirror of souls before they start casting rocks."

          "text": "I love how you all split words and meanings. I'll try to address them as coherently as possible, and in terms most of you can understand:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSo if I leave a sword on a table, and some idiot plunges it in their breast, I am a murderer?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe answer is yes. This has been set by precedence through time in Castle Marrach. If a Courtier sponsors a commoner, they are responsible for the weapon which they have sponsored. Even though the crimes may not be committed by them in person, by sponsoring the person, they have enabled and caused a blade to be in the possession of someone who caused harm, whether that person did so through design or accident.\n\nIn the Royal Army, if your blade is stolen or taken from a person, that soldier is responsible for crimes committed by the next owners of the blade. Through their actions, another obtained their weapon and caused harm. If they had not relinquished the weapon, then the crimes committed by the person with their weapon would not have happened.\n\nThat said, if you were so careless to leave your sword, dagger, or whatever weapon you care to dream up for example, on a table, and it were stolen, it was stolen due to your carelessness. Having your weapon stolen does not alleviate your responsibility to the weapon, your sponsor, and the Crown.\n\nThat is why only Courtiers and beyond may sponsor a blade to a commoner: It is believed that a member of Her Majesty's Court would have the wisdom to wisely sponsor a person. That is why those who are not Honoured Guest may not bear a weapon - they have not proven themselves in the eyes of the Court. And finally, that is why members of the Royal Army can be beheaded for losing their weapons: They have failed the trust placed in them by the Court.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWho wears the Crown Viceran? \nThe Queen or the Lord Boreas? \nSeemed that I saw it on Her head last time I checked.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the crown is an actual physical item, when it comes to law, it does not refer to that crown. Wouldn't it be silly to be taking orders from a piece of jewelry?\n\nWhen it comes to Her Majesty's laws, \"Crown\" refers to the Interests and Concerns of Her Majesty. When a person commits a crime, they do so against the Crown - against the interests and concerns of Her Majesty. Which is why Her Majesty set down laws in the first place: To protect those Interests and Concerns.\n\nI hope we are following so far.\n\nIn order to protect Her Majesty's Concerns and Interests, several organizations were set up: The Royal Army (The Winter Watch, the Royal Guard, Master of Hunt, Master of Horse, War Councils, etc. etc.) Also established was Chancery.\n\nChancery was established to protect Her Majesty's Concerns and Interests, but also to ensure equitable treatment. Of course, everyone has a different idea of what is equitable and what is not, but Chancery functions with Her Majesty's blessings and appointments, so it is assumed that Her Majesty's choices will provide equitable treatment. And who are we to argue with Her Majesty?\n\nNow, to continue.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf any one commit treason, rebellion, conspiracy against the Crown, or espionage, let them suffer beheading, drawing, quartering and expulsion.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn charge of Chancery is the Chancellor. In Her Wisdom, Her Majesty chose her consort, the Winter Knight - Lord Boreas - to protect and represent Her Interests and Concerns through the Court. She has given him the authority to run Chancery, just as Inquisitor Major has been given the responsibility of the Inquisitors, Sir Darvius the responsibility of the Royal Army, Mistress Neerie the responsibility of the Scribes of Chancery..and on and on.\n\nThese choices were made upon the recommendations of Her Majesty's most valued advisors and trusted members of the Royal Court - denizens who have earned their place by Her Majesty's side.\n\nSo while Lord Boreas may not be wearing the crown, he has Her Majesty's blessings to handle matters of Chancery. Else, he would not be the Lord Chancellor. He is there to guard Her Interests, her Concerns, and most importantly, Her Safety.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFinally a question to you, the people of Castle Marrach: Do you believe Lance Zablan is being illegally framed for crimes by the Lord Chancellor simply to hide an embarrassing situation?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFinally, no, I do not believe Lance is being framed. The mattress was in the Inner Bailey for over a month, and no one else had the idiocy to meddle with something that simply one day 'appeared'. Especially in this place, you would think a person would have more common sense. Lance's problems are of his own making, through his carelessness and idiocy.\n\nAs for the charges, they hardly seem trumped up to me: Theft (he admits he took the mattress, though he had no permission or right to do so). Regardless of whether he put it back or not is irrelevant. He took something that did not belong to him, which is theft.\n\nAs for the destruction charge, it's formal name is 'Malicious Mischief'. Malicious Mischief is categorized as vandalism, throwing things off the wall - small amounts of damage.

          "text": "TRIACURS TRIBUNE * I PRINT THE TRUTH\n\nIssue 1, Number 7\n\nTwo years ago in the 11th moon as people reckon time in this place, there was an Honored Guest, sera Katherine, a Rememberer and leader of the Poet's Brotherhood, who was abducted from the parapets and subsequently murdered. When she returned from the Necromancer's, her mind had been tortured so badly before her killing that upon her return she could not even read.\n\nWhat of the murderer? A bloody Rememberer's pin and a few other scant traces of her abduction were recovered from the parapets.\n\nA ser Noel Needler was arrested by the Royal Guard in connection with the crime, but there was only one direct witness -- a newly awoken -- who subsequently disappeared, leaving no one that could testify in court.\n\nNoel was in fact, not even arrested for murder, but only for illegal possession of a weapon: a stiletto with an owl engraved upon it. After serving time, Noel was released, leaving the case unsolved.\n\nA year ago, around the 11th moon, I awoke, and started asking some rather  innocent questions, I thought. This led me to begin to investigate Noel Needler myself, who assured me at first that he had nothing to do with the crime.\n\nHowever, the facts turned up some discrepencies in Noel's story. Most saliently, the fact that he did do it and admitted privately he was glad to do it.\n\nThe most curious thing claimed by Noel, though, was the reason for doing it.\n\nTo protect Lord Boreas.\n\nYes, Noel Needler had \"loyally\" slain sera Katherine because he had the belief this was expressly serving to protect Lord Boreas.\n\nFrom what? Bad verse?\n\nWhile that might almost be understandable in some cases, the reason for her death seems to be more insidious.\n\nNoel indicated he was loyally serving those above him, in a chain of command and conspiracy approving of assassination and corruption as a means of enforcement of policy, allegedly up to and including Lord Gracien and Lord Boreas himself.\n\nThe organization was known as the Owl, and it was and in many ways remains the most feared organization in the castle. They are believed to be utterly loyal to Boreas, and utterly ruthless and unlawful in their methods.\n\nHow could this powerful lord and his supporters have felt threatened by her very existence? What was so dangerous about Katherine?\n\nNothing really.\n\nShe allegedly participated in some scandalous sauna parties. She liked vivid poetry. She helped people remember.\n\nApparently, it was this last issue which signed her death warrant. Who she was helping to remember, and what she wanted to help them remember remain a mystery to this day. It must have been damning if it warranted assassination.\n\nAs I investigated, many people started contacting me, including an \"Anonymous but interested observer,\" who warned and informed me in a series of exchanged messages, all delivered by very nervous-looking servants.\n\nAnonymous but Credible Information\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf you desire to learn the answers, I dissuade you from attempting to dig more deeply. I may be able to steer you towards answers which are more correct than incorrect, but for the sake of your own safety, you must cease these public callings. If you come to the attention of those who truly control this Castle, you shall be...\n\nLet us say that worse things can happen than death here.

          "html": "TRIACURS TRIBUNE * I PRINT THE TRUTH<br>\n<br>\nIssue 1, Number 7<br>\n<br>\nTwo years ago in the 11th moon as people reckon time in this place, there was an Honored Guest, sera Katherine, a Rememberer and leader of the Poet&apos;s Brotherhood, who was abducted from the parapets and subsequently murdered. When she returned from the Necromancer&apos;s, her mind had been tortured so badly before her killing that upon her return she could not even read.<br>\n<br>\nWhat of the murderer? A bloody Rememberer&apos;s pin and a few other scant traces of her abduction were recovered from the parapets.<br>\n<br>\nA ser Noel Needler was arrested by the Royal Guard in connection with the crime, but there was only one direct witness -- a newly awoken -- who subsequently disappeared, leaving no one that could testify in court.<br>\n<br>\nNoel was in fact, not even arrested for murder, but only for illegal possession of a weapon: a stiletto with an owl engraved upon it. After serving time, Noel was released, leaving the case unsolved.<br>\n<br>\nA year ago, around the 11th moon, I awoke, and started asking some rather <a href=\"http://forum.skotos.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=16582\" target=\"_blank\"> innocent questions</a>, I thought. This led me to begin to <a href=\"http://forum.skotos.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5528#post177079\" target=\"_blank\">investigate Noel Needler</a> myself, who assured me at first that he had nothing to do with the crime.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the facts turned up some discrepencies in Noel&apos;s story. Most saliently, the fact that he did do it and admitted privately he was glad to do it.<br>\n<br>\nThe most curious thing claimed by Noel, though, was the reason for doing it.<br>\n<br>\nTo protect Lord Boreas.<br>\n<br>\nYes, Noel Needler had &quot;loyally&quot; slain sera Katherine because he had the belief this was expressly serving to protect Lord Boreas.<br>\n<br>\nFrom what? Bad verse?<br>\n<br>\nWhile that might almost be understandable in some cases, the reason for her death seems to be more insidious.<br>\n<br>\nNoel indicated he was loyally serving those above him, in a chain of command and conspiracy approving of assassination and corruption as a means of enforcement of policy, allegedly up to and including Lord Gracien and Lord Boreas himself.<br>\n<br>\nThe organization was known as the Owl, and it was and in many ways remains the most feared organization in the castle. They are believed to be utterly loyal to Boreas, and utterly ruthless and unlawful in their methods.<br>\n<br>\nHow could this powerful lord and his supporters have felt threatened by her very existence? What was so dangerous about Katherine?<br>\n<br>\nNothing really.<br>\n<br>\nShe allegedly participated in some scandalous sauna parties. She liked vivid poetry. She helped people remember.<br>\n<br>\nApparently, it was this last issue which signed her death warrant. Who she was helping to remember, and what she wanted to help them remember remain a mystery to this day. It must have been damning if it warranted assassination.<br>\n<br>\nAs I investigated, many people started contacting me, including an &quot;Anonymous but interested observer,&quot; who warned and informed me in a series of exchanged messages, all delivered by very nervous-looking servants.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Anonymous but Credible Information</b><br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"bbcode_container\">\n\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container b-icon b-icon__ldquo-l--gray\"></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf you desire to learn the answers, I dissuade you from attempting to dig more deeply.

          "text": "A year ago tonight, I got to meet with Noel again.\n\nNoel was quite good at his job, in many ways. It was often hard to get him to divulge anything by scroll. But rather than turn me into the Winter Watch for false accusations of being a murderer, he invited me to a private conversation.\n\nIn fact Noel was rather insistant about it.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTo the one Triacurs,\n\nI have received your missive, but have no commentary at this\nmoment in time. But, I would request that we meet in private so\nthat I might ask you some more personal questions. For, you\nsee, your own thoughts and opinion are important. Until then, I\nwill not comment on your missive.\n\nIt is signed, \"Noel Needler\", by Noel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSer Triacurs,\n\nI was beginning to wonder if you were ignoring my initial\nmissive. For nearly a moon I checked with the courier and was\nabout to write you again when I happened to receive two\nmissives from you. I do not have a secretary, but I am not\nabout every single day, of course. As for when we should meet,\nI leave you to propose a time. Preferably late at night, if\npossible. But I am flexible with my schedule, if need be.\nPropose a time and I shall inform you if I am able to attend.\n\nIt is signed, \"Noel Needler\", by Noel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSer Triacurs,\n\nI still await your response as to when we can meet.\n\nIt is signed, \"Noel Needler\", by Noel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt was time. I couldn't stall any longer. I made arrangements to meet with Noel one night, exactly a year ago tonight.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSaturday midnight. I guess we missed our tea. Maybe tomorrow.\nIt is signed, \"22 of 12.\", by Triacurs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nI had missed Noel by just a few moments.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSer Triacurs,\n\nIt appears I have received your missive a bit late. As now it\nis half a bell past midnight. A few days more notice would be\nmore suitable.\n\nIt is signed, \"Noel Needler\", by Noel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOn the 23rd of the 12th moon of last year, a year ago as I write this, Noel stepped into the Bowling Alley to meet with me.\n\nNoel: \"I have been thinking about the discussion we had some time ago. And I have a few questions of my own regarding what you think.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Sure. Shoot.\"\n\nNoel: \"Do you believe any of the answers you have been given? Give a clear answer, do not be vague.\"\n\nHe was asking about the Owl, and the murder of Katherine, and Lord Boreas' involvement.\n\nTriacurs: \"I believe a lot of them. Yeah. At least, this is what people believe is going on. I think there's been a lot of deception in all directions. People like the color grey here I notice.\"\n\nNoel: \"What do you believe is true?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"That there's a bunch of sheep, and a bunch of shepards... to cull the sheep when they get out of line.\"\n\nNoel:  \"What would you think of such if it is true? Would you think it wrong?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"It depends. Frankly, there are some people that deserve to be extincted here. Losers and morons.\"\n\nNoel: \"I see... And so you do not mind this... selective culling, then?\n\nTriacurs: \"Some days I just wish I had an axe. Yeah. There are people I wouldn't mind seeing wasted.\"\n\nNoel: \"Hmmm, indeed... What about Lord Boreas? Do you believe that the rumors you have been told about His Excellency are true?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"There's no way they can all be true. All I do know is that he's powerful, he controls the army for all practical purposes, and he's likely not appreciative of anyone trying to get in his way.\"\n\nNoel: \"Indeed. And if His Excellency did remove the people who His Excellency felt would use the knowledge they have for ill, would you still respect and serve His Excellency?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"If he's the boss? Who can say no, right?\"\n\nNoel: \"Of course, no one could say no. But would it be true loyalty on your part?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"True loyalty? Look, the only time I ever met the man he didn't have the bright ray of sunshine for me. I'm scum in his eyes, and I know it. Loyalty is done for different reasons. Love and adoration? I got to admit... It ain't there. The reason I'd be loyal would be because it was keeping me alive and getting getting me to do what you wanted.\"\n\nNoel: \"I see... So only for your survival. You would not serve the Royal Consort, Lord Chancellor and Winter Knight with loyalty. Even though he is of the Second Link on the Great Chain and worthy in the eyes of the Queen to be the Lord Chancellor, Winter Knight and Royal Consort?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"But how could I believe you weren't some petty two-bit crook using the Lord Chancellor's good name to make up some bullshit front for your own organization? In this castle, there's survival, and there's survival. I frankly haven't seen anything to just blindly trust you. You could be setting me up and trying to pin some rap on the Lord Chancellor. This is where trust gets earned. If I just jumped at the chance to be a freaking loyal minion, you'd know I was an idiot. Hell, I'd waste me if I was a no-brained goon.\"\n\nNoel (laughing): \"It is no lie that I have lied before. There are many things which people are better left not to know for their safety and the safety of others. When people gain too much knowledge, they often know not what to do with it and such could be dangerous...\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Exactly. You're trying to figure out... He's a bright boy. But will he behave himself? How long can he be trusted before he becomes a liability? I'm sure whoever took you in had the same questions.\"\n\nNoel: \"There was no question about my loyalty. I sacrificed myself long ago for His Excellency so that I would return to serve once again. I was reawakened some three years ago... perhaps more... I do not remember exactly.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Why are you so loyal? There's got to be some reason.\"\n\nNoel: \"If I sacrificed myself long ago for His Excellency, surely He must have good intentions. Otherwise, I would not have written myself a letter stating what I had done and what I would do when reawakened.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"I see! You obviously got dealt a different hand then I did. You might have to teach me a little of your leap of faith tricks. Other than me staying alive, which apparently can be cured any time hell wants to swallow me up, why would you think I should be totally loyal without question?\"\n\nNoel: \"Leap of faith? Why would I write myself a letter, signed in my own obvious hand, if there were no good intentions?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"I got no idea. I hear people have been brain-wiped... Like Duraze. Mind-fucked into being Aeschlus. Was he being a loyal minion or a traitor?\"\n\nNoel: \"Aeschlus? ...Who is Aeschlus?\"\n\n(This was somewhat amazing to me, considering it was the most traumatic event to occur in the castle in recent history. Either Noel really didn't get out much from his room other than to perform his duties, or he was lying through his teeth. Either that, or he was a complete dupe. So I decided to give him some information, to see if it changed his mind about his loyalty.)\n\nTriacurs: \"You didn't hear about Aeschlus? The whole Alo-Aeschlus battle under the Inner Bailey? The elemental rituals? Hey! This was before my time, but I read about it in the Chronicles even!\"\n\nNoel: \"I did not, nae. And I need to catch up on the Chronicles, it seems.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Duraze... loyal minion... Inquisitor-Major... serves Lord Gracien... only his secret life is being Aeschlus. Aeschlus -- rat bastard. Duraze -- rat bastard too, but without the evil sword from hell to destroy souls and the mental fuck-over powers to make people attack their own friends. Aeschlus was apparently a corrupted Duraze. For all you know, you were a freaking clerk in your last life, brain-washed to wake up and become a hitman.  Was that all? Just a letter to yourself: 'Dear me, when you wake up, make sure you remember where you left your extra pair of glasses, and oh yeah, go murder this list of people?' There's got to be more to it than that.\"\n\nNoel: \"The letter is unmistakably my own. This I came concluded after a long while. Your thoughts of doubt do not influence me. I know my own handwriting when I see it.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"I'm not doubting your handwriting. I'm wondering if you had your brain scrambled like eggs before you put pen to paper. Did you ever wonder why you do this? I mean, hey, if you like murdering, that's one thing. I'm just trying to understand here. Also, the letter is only one part of this. Obviously there had to be something else after the letter.\"\n\n(Apparently I had stepped on Noel's toes, because he started to back-pedal.)\n\nNoel: \"I never spoke of murdering. Such is irrelevant and who says I have murdered anyone?\"\n\nTriacurs: \"So, murdering is out. We're going to talk about something else. You work for the boss. What does he want or need done?\"\n\nNoel: \"I merely wondered where your loyalty lied. I am not here for anything else.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Right now, you can say I'm a chess piece that hasn't been painted. Someone can pick me up, or toss me in the trash. I'm a nobody unless someone wants to change that.\"\n\nNoel: \"If there is anything more... I will meet with you again.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Yeah. I hear what that says. I'll be here.\"\n\nNoel: , \"Do *not* tell anyone of this meeting. I will let you know if there is anything more.\"\n\nTriacurs: \"Got it.\"",

Until then, I<br>\nwill not comment on your missive.<br>\n<br>\nIt is signed, &quot;Noel Needler&quot;, by Noel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div class=\"bbcode_container\">\n\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container b-icon b-icon__ldquo-l--gray\"></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSer Triacurs,<br>\n<br>\nI was beginning to wonder if you were ignoring my initial<br>\nmissive. For nearly a moon I checked with the courier and was<br>\nabout to write you again when I happened to receive two<br>\nmissives from you. I do not have a secretary, but I am not<br>\nabout every single day, of course. As for when we should meet,<br>\nI leave you to propose a time. Preferably late at night, if<br>\npossible. But I am flexible with my schedule, if need be.<br>\nPropose a time and I shall inform you if I am able to attend.<br>\n<br>\nIt is signed, &quot;Noel Needler&quot;, by Noel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div class=\"bbcode_container\">\n\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container b-icon b-icon__ldquo-l--gray\"></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSer Triacurs,<br>\n<br>\nI still await your response as to when we can meet.<br>\n<br>\nIt is signed, &quot;Noel Needler&quot;, by Noel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>It was time. I couldn&apos;t stall any longer. I made arrangements to meet with Noel one night, exactly a year ago tonight.<br>\n<div class=\"bbcode_container\">\n\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container b-icon b-icon__ldquo-l--gray\"></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSaturday midnight.

Maybe tomorrow.<br>\nIt is signed, &quot;22 of 12.&quot;, by Triacurs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>I had missed Noel by just a few moments.<br>\n<div class=\"bbcode_container\">\n\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container b-icon b-icon__ldquo-l--gray\"></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSer Triacurs,<br>\n<br>\nIt appears I have received your missive a bit late. As now it<br>\nis half a bell past midnight. A few days more notice would be<br>\nmore suitable.<br>\n<br>\nIt is signed, &quot;Noel Needler&quot;, by Noel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>On the 23rd of the 12th moon of last year, a year ago as I write this, Noel stepped into the Bowling Alley to meet with me.<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;I have been thinking about the discussion we had some time ago. And I have a few questions of my own regarding what you think.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Sure. Shoot.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;Do you believe any of the answers you have been given? Give a clear answer, do not be vague.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nHe was asking about the Owl, and the murder of Katherine, and Lord Boreas&apos; involvement.<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;I believe a lot of them. Yeah. At least, this is what people believe is going on. I think there&apos;s been a lot of deception in all directions. People like the color grey here I notice.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;What do you believe is true?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;That there&apos;s a bunch of sheep, and a bunch of shepards... to cull the sheep when they get out of line.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel:  &quot;What would you think of such if it is true? Would you think it wrong?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;It depends. Frankly, there are some people that deserve to be extincted here. Losers and morons.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;I see... And so you do not mind this... selective culling, then?<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Some days I just wish I had an axe. Yeah. There are people I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing wasted.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;Hmmm, indeed... What about Lord Boreas? Do you believe that the rumors you have been told about His Excellency are true?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;There&apos;s no way they can all be true. All I do know is that he&apos;s powerful, he controls the army for all practical purposes, and he&apos;s likely not appreciative of anyone trying to get in his way.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;Indeed. And if His Excellency did remove the people who His Excellency felt would use the knowledge they have for ill, would you still respect and serve His Excellency?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;If he&apos;s the boss? Who can say no, right?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;Of course, no one could say no. But would it be true loyalty on your part?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;True loyalty? Look, the only time I ever met the man he didn&apos;t have the bright ray of sunshine for me. I&apos;m scum in his eyes, and I know it. Loyalty is done for different reasons. Love and adoration? I got to admit... It ain&apos;t there. The reason I&apos;d be loyal would be because it was keeping me alive and getting getting me to do what you wanted.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;I see... So only for your survival. You would not serve the Royal Consort, Lord Chancellor and Winter Knight with loyalty. Even though he is of the Second Link on the Great Chain and worthy in the eyes of the Queen to be the Lord Chancellor, Winter Knight and Royal Consort?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;But how could I believe you weren&apos;t some petty two-bit crook using the Lord Chancellor&apos;s good name to make up some bullshit front for your own organization? In this castle, there&apos;s survival, and there&apos;s survival. I frankly haven&apos;t seen anything to just blindly trust you. You could be setting me up and trying to pin some rap on the Lord Chancellor. This is where trust gets earned. If I just jumped at the chance to be a freaking loyal minion, you&apos;d know I was an idiot. Hell, <i>I&apos;d</i> waste me if I was a no-brained goon.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel (laughing): &quot;It is no lie that I have lied before. There are many things which people are better left not to know for their safety and the safety of others. When people gain too much knowledge, they often know not what to do with it and such could be dangerous...&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Exactly. You&apos;re trying to figure out... He&apos;s a bright boy. But will he behave himself? How long can he be trusted before he becomes a liability? I&apos;m sure whoever took you in had the same questions.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;There was no question about my loyalty. I sacrificed myself long ago for His Excellency so that I would return to serve once again. I was reawakened some three years ago... perhaps more... I do not remember exactly.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Why are you so loyal? There&apos;s got to be some reason.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;If I sacrificed myself long ago for His Excellency, surely He must have good intentions. Otherwise, I would not have written myself a letter stating what I had done and what I would do when reawakened.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;I see! You obviously got dealt a different hand then I did. You might have to teach me a little of your leap of faith tricks. Other than me staying alive, which apparently can be cured any time hell wants to swallow me up, why would you think I should be totally loyal without question?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;Leap of faith? Why would I write myself a letter, signed in my own obvious hand, if there were no good intentions?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;I got no idea. I hear people have been brain-wiped... Like Duraze. Mind-fucked into being Aeschlus. Was he being a loyal minion or a traitor?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;Aeschlus? ...Who is Aeschlus?&quot;<br>\n<br>\n(This was somewhat amazing to me, considering it was the most traumatic event to occur in the castle in recent history. Either Noel really didn&apos;t get out much from his room other than to perform his duties, or he was lying through his teeth. Either that, or he was a complete dupe. So I decided to give him some information, to see if it changed his mind about his loyalty.)<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;You didn&apos;t hear about Aeschlus? The whole Alo-Aeschlus battle under the Inner Bailey? The elemental rituals? Hey! This was before my time, but I read about it in the Chronicles even!&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;I did not, nae. And I need to catch up on the Chronicles, it seems.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Duraze... loyal minion... Inquisitor-Major... serves Lord Gracien... only his secret life is being Aeschlus. Aeschlus -- rat bastard. Duraze -- rat bastard too, but without the evil sword from hell to destroy souls and the mental fuck-over powers to make people attack their own friends. Aeschlus was apparently a corrupted Duraze. For all you know, you were a freaking clerk in your last life, brain-washed to wake up and become a hitman.  Was that all? Just a letter to yourself: &apos;Dear me, when you wake up, make sure you remember where you left your extra pair of glasses, and oh yeah, go murder this list of people?&apos; There&apos;s <i>got</i> to be more to it than that.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;The letter is unmistakably my own. This I came concluded after a long while. Your thoughts of doubt do not influence me. I know my own handwriting when I see it.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;I&apos;m not doubting your handwriting. I&apos;m wondering if you had your brain scrambled like eggs before you put pen to paper. Did you ever wonder why you do this? I mean, hey, if you like murdering, that&apos;s one thing. I&apos;m just trying to understand here. Also, the letter is only one part of this. Obviously there had to be something else after the letter.&quot;<br>\n<br>\n(Apparently I had stepped on Noel&apos;s toes, because he started to back-pedal.)<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;I never spoke of murdering. Such is irrelevant and who says I have murdered anyone?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;So, murdering is out. We&apos;re going to talk about something else. You work for the boss. What does he want or need done?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;I merely wondered where your loyalty lied. I am not here for anything else.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Right now, you can say I&apos;m a chess piece that hasn&apos;t been painted. Someone can pick me up, or toss me in the trash. I&apos;m a nobody unless someone wants to change that.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: &quot;If there is anything more... I will meet with you again.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Yeah. I hear what that says. I&apos;ll be here.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nNoel: , &quot;Do *not* tell anyone of this meeting. I will let you know if there is anything more.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nTriacurs: &quot;Got it.&quot;"

          "text": "TRIACURS TRIBUNE * I PRINT THE TRUTH\n\nIssue 1, Number 8\n\nOnly in hushed whispers would people ever speak their name.\n\nThe Owl.\n\nThe Unicorn.\n\nThey played a deadly game of \"human chess\" for centuries. Assassinations by silent blades and poison lethal enough to melt bodies. Undead and sorcerous horrors served them, such as Alo and Aeschlus.\n\nWhy would normally brave swordsmen glance in fright? Why would people urgently seek out this reporter of truth to warn him to shut up immediately or face a certain doom?\n\nWhat was the fear that lurked in every shadow of the castle?\n\nIt was the secret of the Owls and Unicorns.\n\nThese were two secret societies supposedly founded by Lord Boreas himself for his personal entertainment. And to enforce his own brand of secret policy -- surpression of those he disfavored.\n\nHe found the competition lively enough. Lord Gracien was the Owl. Lord Mirshan was the Unicorn. They fought a war for favor using the bodies of minions as their pawns. They exterminated those who stumbled upon their game with casual disdain. They were unstoppable, ruthless, and twisted by dark powers.\n\nLord Mirshan ultimately proved the loser in this war, first being driven underground for his \"crimes.\" Lord Gracien was granted power and favor, placed in charge of the court systems as the victor. As the loser, Lord Mirshan was shown no mercy and had his soul destroyed in a gruesome cabalistic ritual.\n\nThose known to be loyal to the Owl include Helene, Duraze, Sansamor and Noel Needler. An undead monster known as Alo also worked with them, performing assassinations.\n\nDuraze was responsible for recovering a blade known as the Unicorn's Horn to perform the ultimate destruction of Lord Mirshan. The Owls gathered in the secret chambers of the Inner Bailey. Others, who shall remain nameless, tried to thwart the effort, but only arrived in time to watch as sorcerous magics coursed in arcs of lightning about the sword and the doomed lord's body. Then Helene plunged a dagger into Mirshan's chest.

          "html": "TRIACURS TRIBUNE * I PRINT THE TRUTH<br>\n<br>\nIssue 1, Number 8<br>\n<br>\nOnly in hushed whispers would people ever speak their name.<br>\n<br>\nThe Owl.<br>\n<br>\nThe Unicorn.<br>\n<br>\nThey played a deadly game of &quot;human chess&quot; for centuries. Assassinations by silent blades and poison lethal enough to melt bodies. Undead and sorcerous horrors served them, such as Alo and Aeschlus.<br>\n<br>\nWhy would normally brave swordsmen glance in fright? Why would people urgently seek out this reporter of truth to warn him to shut up immediately or face a certain doom?<br>\n<br>\nWhat was the fear that lurked in every shadow of the castle?<br>\n<br>\nIt was the secret of the Owls and Unicorns.<br>\n<br>\nThese were two secret societies supposedly founded by Lord Boreas himself for his personal entertainment. And to enforce his own brand of secret policy -- surpression of those he disfavored.<br>\n<br>\nHe found the competition lively enough. Lord Gracien was the Owl. Lord Mirshan was the Unicorn. They fought a war for favor using the bodies of minions as their pawns. They exterminated those who stumbled upon their game with casual disdain. They were unstoppable, ruthless, and twisted by dark powers.<br>\n<br>\nLord Mirshan ultimately proved the loser in this war, first being driven underground for his &quot;crimes.&quot; Lord Gracien was granted power and favor, placed in charge of the court systems as the victor. As the loser, Lord Mirshan was shown no mercy and had his soul destroyed in a gruesome cabalistic ritual.<br>\n<br>\nThose known to be loyal to the Owl include Helene, Duraze, Sansamor and Noel Needler. An undead monster known as Alo also worked with them, performing assassinations.<br>\n<br>\nDuraze was responsible for recovering a blade known as the Unicorn&apos;s Horn to perform the ultimate destruction of Lord Mirshan. The Owls gathered in the secret chambers of the Inner Bailey. Others, who shall remain nameless, tried to thwart the effort, but only arrived in time to watch as sorcerous magics coursed in arcs of lightning about the sword and the doomed lord&apos;s body. Then Helene plunged a dagger into Mirshan&apos;s chest.

          "text": "Hunting of the Unicorn\n\nThe Unicorn, if they were once mighty and feared, passed long into obscurity in recent years. Their leader, Lord Mirshan, was driven underground and disgraced by his enemies.\n\nIt was said his minions were one by one neutralized or hunted into extinction. A certain courtier, named Richarde, known as a fencing maestro, was one such.\n\nHe was accused of \"treason,\" and \"committed suicide\" under mysterious circumstances. Before his death, he sent a box to his last student of fencing, Pete. In that box was a magical sword, made of some unknown white metal, and fancifully shaped somewhat in the spiral style of a Unicorn's horn. Pete was told to keep it safe lest it fall into the wrong hands.\n\nUnfortunately, Duraze found out where it was being kept. Though he ostensibly pretended to be the snake in the grass who wanted to bring down the Owl, instead he betrayed Pete and his other allies.\n\nThe blade was turned over to the Owl.\n\nWhen Lord Mirshan was captured, this blade was corrupted in the ritual, and his life and soul were taken from him with a dagger plunged into his heart.\n\nThe Squire otherwise seems clueless as to who or what the Unicorn was, and guilt-ridden over having anything to do with the sword. By giving the sword over to Duraze, it resulted in the death not just of Lord Mirshan, but of Edouard Ramos at a later time.\n\nBefore anyone begins to weep over the loss of the Unicorn, apparently his life story was not one of sweetness and joy.\n\nSupposedly others who sought to serve him were more than capable of causing death, such as the bloody fatality of Garrik Peters in the Royal Chapel. Here was a case of another Rememberer who ran afoul of the powers-that-be. But why was he killed? Rumors say he was ordered slain as a result of betraying secrets he learned about the Unicorn to others. The official story was that he tripped and fell on a Unicorn-decorated dagger. Those present at the time included Royal Handmaiden Alacia, Margaret, Illiana, and Gareth.\n\nMargaret was said to be a Unicorn. She had come under suspicion of the Owl early on when she had proposed throwing a \"Spring Fling.\" Since this sort of non-Wintery talk was disapproved of by the Owl, they had visited her, making sure that she understood that no such unseasonal talk would be tolerated. She was given an Owl-decorated bracelet to wear by Helene and warned she was being watched. The event was renamed the Winter Carnival. Margaret was coincidentally considered a brother to Sansamor. She was tormented by Sansamor's darker second-self, a creature known as Sansloy. She and Davog were kidnapped for a time, and later released. At some point she was recruited for the Unicorn, though her role is uncertain. As time wore on, the pressure of kidnappings and intrigues became increasingly unbearable, until she went mad and disappeared.\n\nIlliana was also said to have been a Unicorn. She too was kidnapped and held prisoner for a while. However, later she was made to give up whatever allegiance she had to the Unicorn in return for protection directly from Lord Boreas. There are some who allege Illiana became the mistress of Lord Boreas, or at least, enjoys parading around in his chambers while he's not fully dressed.\n\nIlliana's other indiscretions were reported to me long ago, by an anonymous but interested observer. It was said of her, \"watch out for Illiana. That witch has secrets that are old and dangerous. She has shown others the secret room beneath the stables (I assume that is the one) and used it as a hideaway for her infidelities against her husband (the Corporal of the Watch prior to Jarrod).\"\n\nIlliana maintains that she is loyal to Lord Boreas. Quite so. Loyal to a fault, one would think.\n\nBefore his disappearance, Gareth said that he was part of the group that tried, and failed, to rescue the Unicorn from his death, but that he never actually met the Unicorn. Gareth never did have much luck in the Royal Chapel. Besides witnessing the \"fatal accident\" with Garrik, he was also murdered in the Royal Chapel, along with Lady Nadira, the old Priestess, not long after having a public confrontation with Helene about the corruption in the Inner Bailey. The arrested murderer, a Watchman named Haemos, was once claimed by Gareth as his own son. Haemos died mysteriously in the dungeon of poison, babbling madly to the end that he had to protect the Consort -- then his body melted.\n\nGareth was later banished permanently from the Inner Bailey due to a nasty case of disfavor from the Queen and her Consort. The cause was most curious. Duraze, his supposed ally in trying to end the Owl's dominion, turned out to be parading around in disguise as Aeschlus. This Aeschlus was responsible for the kidnap and poisoning of Mistress Avaria. In exchange for an antidote, Gareth was ordered to murder the First Acolyte, Charmiam. He was told that if he would murder the First Acolyte, it would bring Summer. When he naively informed the Queen about this plot, Gareth was banished for believing in this \"myth\" of Summer. Boreas called it more of a \"disease.\" After his banishment, now tidily ejected from the Court forever, a cure was provided for Avaria. He always maintained he was not a Unicorn, and just a pawn in their game. Gareth's whereabouts are now unknown. He disappeared under mysterious circumstances, said to have left in a dream to a green and sunny land.\n\nAlacia seems to be the last survivor from the incident in the Royal Chapel, so whatever happened there is now her little secret. But since she's been around for centuries, one might imagine she'd have a lot of other interesting stories she could tell.",

Though he ostensibly pretended to be the snake in the grass who wanted to bring down the Owl, instead he betrayed Pete and his other allies.<br>\n<br>\nThe blade was turned over to the Owl.<br>\n<br>\nWhen Lord Mirshan was captured, this blade was corrupted in the ritual, and his life and soul were taken from him with a dagger plunged into his heart.<br>\n<br>\nThe Squire otherwise seems clueless as to who or what the Unicorn was, and guilt-ridden over having anything to do with the sword. By giving the sword over to Duraze, it resulted in the death not just of Lord Mirshan, but of <a href=\"http://forum.skotos.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1205\" target=\"_blank\">Edouard Ramos</a> at a later time.<br>\n<br>\nBefore anyone begins to weep over the loss of the Unicorn, apparently his life story was not one of sweetness and joy.<br>\n<br>\nSupposedly others who sought to serve him were more than capable of causing death, such as the bloody fatality of Garrik Peters in the Royal Chapel. Here was a case of another Rememberer who ran afoul of the powers-that-be. But why was he killed? Rumors say he was ordered slain as a result of betraying secrets he learned about the Unicorn to others. The official story was that he tripped and fell on a Unicorn-decorated dagger. Those present at the time included Royal Handmaiden Alacia, Margaret, Illiana, and Gareth.<br>\n<br>\nMargaret was said to be a Unicorn. She had come under suspicion of the Owl early on when she had proposed throwing a &quot;Spring Fling.&quot; Since this sort of non-Wintery talk was disapproved of by the Owl, they had visited her, making sure that she understood that no such unseasonal talk would be tolerated. She was given an Owl-decorated bracelet to wear by Helene and warned she was being watched. The event was renamed the Winter Carnival. Margaret was coincidentally considered a brother to Sansamor. She was tormented by Sansamor&apos;s darker second-self, a creature known as Sansloy. She and Davog were kidnapped for a time, and later released. At some point she was recruited for the Unicorn, though her role is uncertain. As time wore on, the pressure of kidnappings and intrigues became increasingly unbearable, until she went mad and disappeared.<br>\n<br>\nIlliana was also said to have been a Unicorn. She too was kidnapped and held prisoner for a while. However, later she was made to give up whatever allegiance she had to the Unicorn in return for protection directly from Lord Boreas. There are some who allege Illiana became the mistress of Lord Boreas, or at least, enjoys parading around in his chambers while he&apos;s not fully dressed.<br>\n<br>\nIlliana&apos;s other indiscretions were reported to me long ago, by an anonymous but interested observer. It was said of her, &quot;watch out for Illiana. That witch has secrets that are old and dangerous. She has shown others the secret room beneath the stables (I assume that is the one) and used it as a hideaway for her infidelities against her husband (the Corporal of the Watch prior to Jarrod).&quot;<br>\n<br>\nIlliana maintains that she is loyal to Lord Boreas. Quite so. Loyal to a fault, one would think.<br>\n<br>\nBefore his disappearance, Gareth said that he was part of the group that tried, and failed, to rescue the Unicorn from his death, but that he never actually met the Unicorn. Gareth never did have much luck in the Royal Chapel. Besides witnessing the &quot;fatal accident&quot; with Garrik, he was also murdered in the Royal Chapel, along with Lady Nadira, the old Priestess, not long after having a public confrontation with Helene about the corruption in the Inner Bailey. The arrested murderer, a Watchman named Haemos, was once claimed by Gareth as his own son. Haemos died mysteriously in the dungeon of poison, babbling madly to the end that he had to protect the Consort -- then his body melted.<br>\n<br>\nGareth was later banished permanently from the Inner Bailey due to a nasty case of disfavor from the Queen and her Consort. The cause was most curious. Duraze, his supposed ally in trying to end the Owl&apos;s dominion, turned out to be parading around in disguise as Aeschlus. This Aeschlus was responsible for the kidnap and poisoning of Mistress Avaria. In exchange for an antidote, Gareth was ordered to murder the First Acolyte, Charmiam. He was told that if he would murder the First Acolyte, it would bring Summer. When he naively informed the Queen about this plot, Gareth was banished for believing in this &quot;myth&quot; of Summer. Boreas called it more of a &quot;disease.&quot; After his banishment, now tidily ejected from the Court forever, a cure was provided for Avaria. He always maintained he was not a Unicorn, and just a pawn in their game. Gareth&apos;s whereabouts are now unknown. He disappeared under mysterious circumstances, said to have left in a dream to a green and sunny land.<br>\n<br>\nAlacia seems to be the last survivor from the incident in the Royal Chapel, so whatever happened there is now her little secret. But since she&apos;s been around for centuries, one might imagine she&apos;d have a lot of other interesting stories she could tell."

          "text": "Frey's Day, 27th Day, 5th Moon, 6th YRA\n\n\nMaster Trader Delights\n''I've loved every minute of his visit''!\n\nThe Master Trader Ali-Jahib has arrived at the Keep, bringing many wondrous and strange things with him to barter. He is staying until Tuesday (31st). His times and locations of trade are posted upon the common notice-boards in the lecture hall. Kindly denizens are in the habit of gifting new guests with items to trade with the Master Trader for something interesting. The general consensus of denizens is that Master Ali's visits are a delightful and welcome event.\n\nSays sera Claudia of Master Trader Ali: ''Lovely man. Very pleasant, and has a great stock of wonderful things.'' She says she intends to trade with him for a specific thing, ''a certain type of sphere.''\n\nSays sera Glyphe Rochaire of Master Trader Ali: ''I haven't bartered with him today but I intend to when he arrives. The Master Trader is a fine fellow and his visits are a joy.'' The generous sera Glyphe also said that she was willing to gift others with items to use in bartering with the Master Trader, stating, ''My room has accumulated a lot of sundries and this is the perfect opportunity for a clearing-out.'' Sera Glyphe herself wishes to trade for a beautiful old dagger, which she says she has wanted since she saw it last time the Master Trader visited.\n\nSays ser Marcellius, Inquisitor, of Master Trader Ali: ''I look forward to meeting with him indeed. I have a few items in mind.'' He politely declined to elaborate.\n\nComments Mistress Avaria, Mistress of the Royal Archives, ''I think that Master Ali-Jahib is a fascinating individual and I look forward to his visits every year. He has, traditionally, been quite generous, as has Her Majesty, to allow us two visits a year. I could wish certain restrictions were not in place, but I understand why they are.''\n\nSaid sera Rosalind Camaret of Master Ali, ''I've loved every minute of his visit.''\n\n''I traded with the First Wife,'' said Acolyte Nizhoni; ''She is lovely.'' ''Next time I will wear rags so she will not think I have too many things to trade.''\n\nMany denizens have already bartered for some fine or curious item, including:\n\nSer Adahn: an amazing ivory staff, carved to resemble a dragon and decorated with jewels. (Bartered for with a book of seventy-five stories, and a jeweled girdle from his significant other.)\nSer Fez: a gilded baldric.\nSera Rosalind: a silver hip belt.\nSer Voltamir: a miniature hourglass on a chain.\nSer Pete: a kite.\nSera Nizhoni: a set of wind chimes.\nSer Sin: a figurine.\nSera Tamiko: a pair of colourful feather earrings.\nSera Finna: an ant farm.\n\nFrey's Day Morning Trading\nRuckus in the Tent!\n\nWith a sharp crack, Master Ali appeared in the courtyard only a quarter of an hour after the appointed time of nine in the morning. Setting up his apparently small, but inwardly expansive tent, he bid all assembled welcome, saying: ''Thus the Master Trader invites three to his Tent, this brightest of mornings!''\n\nInside the first customers were greeted by Master Ali's First Wife; ''I am the first wife of Master Ali, and to him goes all my honour. Nothing better can be, perhaps apart from a very good trade.''\n\n''This place is a wonderous place, far outshining many realms that I do visit. There are gems to be found here that are not found in elsewhere to the places that I have traveled,'' The Master Trader commented, when asked of his opinion of Castle Marrach.\n\nThe tent was indeed filled with many a wondrous item, the majority of which are helpfully listed upon the public notice-boards.\n\nSera Glyphe did ask to see the section of the tent behind the heavy curtains, to which Master Trader Ali said, ''If you would give us but a moment, there is something in the back I must... something that requires attention. Usually I have set things aright, but this morning a special trade was done, before coming here. Would you be so kind to allow this us to set it alright?'' All politely agreed, and the Master Trader excused himself and disappeared to the back of the tent. The First Wife kindly and professionally assisted customers in completing their trades meanwhile. ''Please do take a look around and see what your heart might desire. My masterful husband has had many good and honourable trades upon his wide travels,'' she said. All were also cautioned about entering the back of the tent. ''No one to enter in there while he deals with that very special thing,'' the First Wife said. Eventually there came a loud ruckus from behind the curtain, then an audible pop, and then Master Ali re-entered the main section of the tent, smoothing his robes.\n\nWhen asked what he had been doing in the back, Master Ali said, ''You could say I was ensureing a proper protection was in place to protect the guests that visit my tent.'' When asked if there was something dangerous in the tent, he replied, ''No longer, no.'' When this line of questioning was pursued, the First Wife a previous instruction: Master Trader Ali-Jahib was too busy to grant an interview, though the possibility of one at a later time was left open.\n\nSuch items as these were acquired on this morning:\n\nSer Mikhayl: a painting kit.\nSer Crispian: a quill pen.\nSera Glyphe: an iron dagger.\nSera Aecera: a necklace of coloured glass beads.\nSer Seoman: an odd locust recorder.\nSera Helena: a lavender jade ring. (Nicely matching her eyes, as many noticed.)\nSera Morgane: a four-leaf clover.\nSera Sariaha: a kameez-dress.\nSer Phelan: a miniature ship in a bottle. (A pirate ship named Revenge.)\nSera Ryssa: a delicate apple lute.\n\nAfter the days trading was over, with sera Ryssa the last customer, the Master Trader stepped out and miraculously folded up his tent. Bowing, he said, ''A most enlightening day it has been. Alas a time of rest is required, else I would be honored by more of your trades. A pleasant day to each of you.'' With that, he disappeared in a loud crack and a flash of light.\n\n\nAbsentee Apprentices\n\nMistress Ermengarde, the Royal Seamstress, reportedly has (roughly) eleven apprentices, but it is said that only four of them are active at any one time.\n\nSera Carella, seamstress apprentice, declined to comment. ''I don't have a comment to give,'' said she.\n\nSays sera Aureliana Camaret, ''It really is their own personal business and that of the seamstresses.'' ''Take it from me, continue to poke your nose into people's business so obviously and you will not make many allies. Subtlety is a way of life here.''\n\nThe recently returned seamstress apprentice Glyphe Rochaire was reached for comment, and said that ''Some of the Apprentices have taken to their rooms, indeed, but that's not unusual of any group in the castle. There was a time when only six apprentices were taken on, but things have changed.''\n\nAre we facing a shortage of dresses, pants, and lacy things? Further details are forthcoming, exclusively!\n\n\nSvets the Mimic\nSera Thwapped\n\nIn the morning, the people gathered in the gate courtyard were treated to the odd antics of a man called Svets. He mimicked voices expertly, and recited obscenities unfit for reproduction that someone had apparently spoken to him. He also sang a children's song, and repeated some random snippets of speech. He caused some amusement, no little discomfort and concern, and certainly some offense.\n\nYeoman Keyana commented, ''He isn't quite right in the head ser, he repeats things that people say. I'm sure someone taught him that (the obscenities). He doesn't have much more brains than a parrot.''\n\nAs Svets' singing reached a higher register, sera Tristana pleaded, covering her ears, ''Dear lord, arrest him,'' to which Yeoman Keyana said, ''Why, he isn't hurting himself? And if I arrest him for singing, I got to (sic) arrest everyone for singing. At least he's not giving us Shad quotes anymore.''\n\nThe Yeoman also commented that Svets the Mimic had broken her nose twice, but would not elaborate on ''Shad quotes'' more than to say, ''Things that Shad would say.'' The identity of this ''Shad'' remains unclear, though it could be inferred that the Yeoman was referring to the obscenities uttered by Svets.\n\nAt a slightly later juncture, Svets hit a sera on the head with a book. Yeoman Keyana bodily restrained and apprehended Svets the Mimic, and took him away. ''Come on, you know the drill,'' said the Yeoman as she walked Svets out of the courtyard. Svets struggled and screamed.\n\n''She's not hurting him. She's just taking him somewhere to calm down,'' volunteered Mistress Avaria.\n\nThe victim, when asked her name, pouted: ''I scarce want my name to go down in the annals as the Thwapped Sera.'' She remains anonymous.\n\nNot ten minutes later, Yeoman Keyana returned with Svets, and instructed him to apologise. This met with some difficulties, on account of Svets' mimicking. The Yeoman offered no further comment of the incident.\n\n\nChroniclers Accepting Applications\n\nSer Voltamir Kysarian is accepting applications for the Chroniclers.\n\n''Yeah, I put the post on the boards. Should explain what you have to do,'' says ser Voltamir.\n\nSee the public notice-board nearest to you for further details.\n\n\nNew Arrivals\n\nNew arrivals today in the Castle include: ser Crispian, ser Draclan, ser Podo, ser Turmescula, sera Dorthy",

There are gems to be found here that are not found in elsewhere to the places that I have traveled,&apos;&apos; The Master Trader commented, when asked of his opinion of Castle Marrach.<br>\n<br>\nThe tent was indeed filled with many a wondrous item, the majority of which are helpfully listed upon the public notice-boards.<br>\n<br>\nSera Glyphe did ask to see the section of the tent behind the heavy curtains, to which Master Trader Ali said, &apos;&apos;If you would give us but a moment, there is something in the back I must... something that requires attention. Usually I have set things aright, but this morning a special trade was done, before coming here. Would you be so kind to allow this us to set it alright?&apos;&apos; All politely agreed, and the Master Trader excused himself and disappeared to the back of the tent. The First Wife kindly and professionally assisted customers in completing their trades meanwhile. &apos;&apos;Please do take a look around and see what your heart might desire. My masterful husband has had many good and honourable trades upon his wide travels,&apos;&apos; she said. All were also cautioned about entering the back of the tent. &apos;&apos;No one to enter in there while he deals with that very special thing,&apos;&apos; the First Wife said. Eventually there came a loud ruckus from behind the curtain, then an audible pop, and then Master Ali re-entered the main section of the tent, smoothing his robes.<br>\n<br>\nWhen asked what he had been doing in the back, Master Ali said, &apos;&apos;You could say I was ensureing a proper protection was in place to protect the guests that visit my tent.&apos;&apos; When asked if there was something dangerous in the tent, he replied, &apos;&apos;No longer, no.&apos;&apos; When this line of questioning was pursued, the First Wife a previous instruction: Master Trader Ali-Jahib was too busy to grant an interview, though the possibility of one at a later time was left open.<br>\n<br>\nSuch items as these were acquired on this morning:<br>\n<br>\nSer Mikhayl: a painting kit.<br>\nSer Crispian: a quill pen.<br>\nSera Glyphe: an iron dagger.<br>\nSera Aecera: a necklace of coloured glass beads.<br>\nSer Seoman: an odd locust recorder.<br>\nSera Helena: a lavender jade ring. (Nicely matching her eyes, as many noticed.)<br>\nSera Morgane: a four-leaf clover.<br>\nSera Sariaha: a kameez-dress.<br>\nSer Phelan: a miniature ship in a bottle. (A pirate ship named Revenge.)<br>\nSera Ryssa: a delicate apple lute.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the days trading was over, with sera Ryssa the last customer, the Master Trader stepped out and miraculously folded up his tent. Bowing, he said, &apos;&apos;A most enlightening day it has been. Alas a time of rest is required, else I would be honored by more of your trades. A pleasant day to each of you.&apos;&apos; With that, he disappeared in a loud crack and a flash of light.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\"><b>Absentee Apprentices</b></span><br>\n<br>\nMistress Ermengarde, the Royal Seamstress, reportedly has (roughly) eleven apprentices, but it is said that only four of them are active at any one time.<br>\n<br>\nSera Carella, seamstress apprentice, declined to comment. &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t have a comment to give,&apos;&apos; said she.<br>\n<br>\nSays sera Aureliana Camaret, &apos;&apos;It really is their own personal business and that of the seamstresses.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Take it from me, continue to poke your nose into people&apos;s business so obviously and you will not make many allies. Subtlety is a way of life here.&apos;&apos;<br>\n<br>\nThe recently returned seamstress apprentice Glyphe Rochaire was reached for comment, and said that &apos;&apos;Some of the Apprentices have taken to their rooms, indeed, but that&apos;s not unusual of any group in the castle. There was a time when only six apprentices were taken on, but things have changed.&apos;&apos;<br>\n<br>\nAre we facing a shortage of dresses, pants, and lacy things? Further details are forthcoming, exclusively!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\"><b>Svets the Mimic</b></span><br>\n<b>Sera Thwapped</b><br>\n<br>\nIn the morning, the people gathered in the gate courtyard were treated to the odd antics of a man called Svets. He mimicked voices expertly, and recited obscenities unfit for reproduction that someone had apparently spoken to him. He also sang a children&apos;s song, and repeated some random snippets of speech. He caused some amusement, no little discomfort and concern, and certainly some offense.<br>\n<br>\nYeoman Keyana commented, &apos;&apos;He isn&apos;t quite right in the head ser, he repeats things that people say. I&apos;m sure someone taught him that (the obscenities). He doesn&apos;t have much more brains than a parrot.&apos;&apos;<br>\n<br>\nAs Svets&apos; singing reached a higher register, sera Tristana pleaded, covering her ears, &apos;&apos;Dear lord, arrest him,&apos;&apos; to which Yeoman Keyana said, &apos;&apos;Why, he isn&apos;t hurting himself? And if I arrest him for singing, I got to (sic) arrest everyone for singing. At least he&apos;s not giving us Shad quotes anymore.&apos;&apos;<br>\n<br>\nThe Yeoman also commented that Svets the Mimic had broken her nose twice, but would not elaborate on &apos;&apos;Shad quotes&apos;&apos; more than to say, &apos;&apos;Things that Shad would say.&apos;&apos; The identity of this &apos;&apos;Shad&apos;&apos; remains unclear, though it could be inferred that the Yeoman was referring to the obscenities uttered by Svets.<br>\n<br>\nAt a slightly later juncture, Svets hit a sera on the head with a book. Yeoman Keyana bodily restrained and apprehended Svets the Mimic, and took him away. &apos;&apos;Come on, you know the drill,&apos;&apos; said the Yeoman as she walked Svets out of the courtyard. Svets struggled and screamed.<br>\n<br>\n&apos;&apos;She&apos;s not hurting him. She&apos;s just taking him somewhere to calm down,&apos;&apos; volunteered Mistress Avaria.<br>\n<br>\nThe victim, when asked her name, pouted: &apos;&apos;I scarce want my name to go down in the annals as the Thwapped Sera.&apos;&apos; She remains anonymous.<br>\n<br>\nNot ten minutes later, Yeoman Keyana returned with Svets, and instructed him to apologise. This met with some difficulties, on account of Svets&apos; mimicking. The Yeoman offered no further comment of the incident.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\"><b>Chroniclers Accepting Applications</b></span><br>\n<br>\nSer Voltamir Kysarian is accepting applications for the Chroniclers.<br>\n<br>\n&apos;&apos;Yeah, I put the post on the boards.

He very generously granted us an interview before his first trades.\n\n- What is your full name and title?\n\n''My name is Master Ali-Jahib, a trader who travels all the known and maybe the unknown world as well.''\n\n- Where are you from?\n\n''Here and there, all over, though I do have a home far far away, where I spend time resting up and restocking. It'll suffice to say that it is from a far away land called Araby.\n\nSome secrets comes at a high price, and you have already been granted your trade for this visit.''\n\n(Master Ali very professionally took a moment to see to his customers at this juncture.)\n\n- How do you come here?\n\n''The details of such would be one of those secrets that would cost. You have seen how I travel inside this castle, you could assume that such like methods are employed for travel to other remote places.''\n\n- Where else do you visit?\n\n''The whole wide world. It would take too long to list all places I have visited as there are so many I can hardly remember them all. Though, if you ask those who previously have traded with myself and listened to my tales, you might get an inkling of what placed I have seen.\n\nMany wonderous places have I seen, places that even your imagination would have difficulties imagining.''\n\n- How do you like it here?\n\n''Why would a travelling merchant such as myself come to visit a place? Of course because there are good trades to be had. This place is a wonderous place to trade, there need be no other reason.\n\nAs I said, my good man, I find this Castle a most wonderous and magical place to visit. There are plenty of good trades here, the denizens are most skilled in the art of haggling and every visit brings much honour to my house.''\n\n\nWith this, the interview ended.

It was surmised the Yeoman had died, and several people, including a Rememberer, escorted the Yeoman away to assist her in recovering her memory. It is suspected the Yeoman was killed in the line of duty. The Royal Guard was unable to provide further details.\n\nWe are told, however, that, sera Lorana had an illegal falchion, and that two Yeomen attempted to take it from her. One of the Yeomen and sera Lorana were killed. This is yet to be confirmed, but this journalist has been provided with several names in conjunction to the case.\n\nMore details to come!\n\n\nJournalists Wanted\nBecome A Correspondent\n\nThe Happenings needs journalists and correspondents, as a single person can not even begin to cover the entirety of the Castle's daily events.\n\nEverything is news!\n\nJournalists:\n- Should be willing to send in articles regularly, on no less than a weekly basis;\n- Should be of an inquiring, truth-seeking mind, and able to maintain neutrality;\n- Will be credited for their articles;\n- Can write about anything current and topical.\n\nCorrespondents:\n- Should choose one area or subject on which to correspond regularly, on no less than a weekly basis;\n- Should have some connection to that area or subject;\n- Will be credited for their articles;\n- Are encouraged to write specifically about the affairs, meetings, and events of their one chosen group, preferrably attending such meetings and events to cover them.\n\nAll submissions will be edited for length, grammar, spelling, and content; and correspondents may be relieved that they need not spend all their time worrying about such. The facts will be retained, but unless the article is strictly an opinion piece, opinions and blatant interpretations will be edited out.\n\nWe want the Truth!\n\nWe are also looking for a capable sketch artist, willing to stand by to cover, possibly on very short notice, matters, sketching people, scenes, items, or places; charcoal or ink sketches only, to be copied twice.\n\nLastly, anonymous tips and leads of news are accepted, and will be investigated as time allows. Please include as much detail as you can, and feel free to include your name and specify if you wish to be mentioned as a source.\n\nAll scrolls should be sent to Crispian Larkin.\n\n\nKiller Released\nMurderer Returns To Society\n\nSer Mortarion, described as a professional criminal, was released a few days past. On the 14th Day of this moon, Her Majesty's Court of High Justice found Mortarion guilty of eight counts of bloody assault, one count of kidnapping, and one count of murder. He was beheaded twice, and whipped. He is now returning to Castle society.\n\nMortarion was arrested for crimes committed with ser Fenring, a traitorous Watchman. Their motivations are unclear.\n\nWatchman Fenring consorted with Mortarion, a known criminal. Eventually, Mortarion was cornered in the courtyard, but Fenring stabbed another Watchman in the back, and both of the villains escaped. The Watch caught up with the pair on several occasions, resulting in bloody confrontations, but both were arrested in the end. (There is a Chronicle from the time detailing one such confrontation, resulting in the deaths of a Watchman and both of the criminals, but in no captures.) Fenring has never been brought to trial.\n\n\nAssistant Training Program\n\nThe Courtesy Circle organizes and runs a training program for assistants and secretaries.\n\nAssistants are taught courtly behaviour, proper writing form, and how to place orders for their employer.\n\n''Courtesy begins with respect in ones self, and is the striving of showing the same respect to others.''\n\nContact sera Fate Alaria [OOC: Fatealaria] if you are interested in learning more, or in taking advantage of the program.\n\n\nAstrology Lecture\n\nProfessor Dittersdorf (Fellow of Astrology) plans a public lecture in the courtyard on this Woden's Day, the 1st, half-past eight late bells. All are welcome to attend. There will be a star-viewing with a telescope, to penetrate the clouds. This is a rare opportunity for most denizens to see the stars, usually hidden.\n\nSays Professor Dittersdorf: ''It (the lecture) is entitled Constellations of Glory, and it shall be regarding those constellations with epic stories behind them such they are quite regular fixtures to our heavens.''

          "text": "Thor's Day, 2nd Day, 6th Moon, 6th YRA\n\nRememberers To Revive Phoenix!\n\nThe Rememberers hope to perform a ritual to resurrect a phoenix. Ser Gareth and ser Trisan, of the Rememberers, acquired a phoenix's ashes and a phoenix's feather from Master Ali-Jahib. It is hoped that these are parts of the same phoenix.\n\nThe Rememberers are a group that studies past lives. According to ser Trisan, they learned of the ritual to return the phoenix by dreaming with the ashes and feather. ''There is much contemplation, hard work, and dedication going towards this. We will simply have to wait and see what is next and what the results are,'' says ser Trisan.\n\n\nThe Truth Defends Itself\n\nThe Happenings were treated to an interview with sera Jacicus, who was referred to in an article about the whippings of ser Shadust and sera Jacicus, in issue III (29th Day, 5th Moon, 6th YRA) of the Happenings.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSera Jacicus told the reporter to take a seat. ''You have some explaining to do.''\nThis was acknowledged as obviously referring to the article. The reporter invited sera Jacicus to offer a correction, to be considered for posting in this issue.\n\nJacicus countered by opining that the news should be ''completely removed from the public eye.''\nThis was declined by the reporter: ''If the truth makes you uncomfortable, or you feel it is disadvantageous to you ... examine your own actions.'' The possibility of a correction was pointed out again.\n\nJacicus shouted, calling the news drivel, questioning whether it was the truth, and claiming that the reporter had no right to post her ''personal affairs'' without her knowledge. ''You stepped over a line,'' she growled.\nThis was contested by the reporter, on the basis that any matter of the law or crime and punishment is something the public has the right to know, and is not a personal affair at all. The posting of a correction and an apology was offered.\n\nJacicus questioned whether the information regarding the case had been gained directly from the Royal Guard.\nIt was admitted by the reporter that this was not the case (the source quoted in the article, Squire Pete, was the main source for information on this, as the Yeomen asked of the matter have refused to comment). Jacicus was invited, again, to point out all false and incorrect information in the article.\n\nInstead, Jacicus repeated what had just been told her, to reiterate it, and said that the posting had damaged her own reputation and the reputation of the Awakeners. This reporter was told to ''learn where that line is'', or ''you'll step over it and get yourself in a whole lot of trouble.''\nThe reporter maintained that unless the article had inadverdently been false or incorrect, then any damage had been caused by Jacicus' own actions, and that there is nothing wrong in making the Truth public. ''The Truth only hurts the wicked.''\n\nJacicus insinuated that the reporter was not listening, and was ''too wrapped up in (their) own mind.''\nShe was invited to offer corrections, again.\n\nJacicus pointed out, again, that no quote was acquired from the Guard, and suggested that the reporter speak to the Captain of the Royal Guard and ''get her to explain why this is wrong.''\nThe reporter replied, pointing out that Jacicus was not offering a correction to the article, that she was not upset over the truthfulness or falsity of the article, but rather over the fact that the matter was publicized. ''I will not be intimidated or bullied. If I posted the Truth, then I have done right.'' The reporter maintained that if the Royal Guard had indeed arrested, found guilty, and whipped Jacicus, then any wrongdoing here had been on her part, and pointed out that she should have thought of her and the Awakeners' reputation before such actions as lead to this were taken. Jacicus was again invited to offer corrections. If no falsehoods were posted, then the source of the Truth is irrelevant in this case.\n\nJacicus shouted at the reporter again, telling him to get out and never ''dare cross (Jacicus') path again.''\nThe reporter politely ignored this outburst, and restated their view that Jacicus had not shown any falsehood or wrongdoing on the reporter's part, and that the cause of her upset seemed to be the Truth.\n\nJacicus said that all the article had done was destroy the Awakeners' morale and reputation. ''Think before you leap,'' she admonished. (The Awakeners, however, were mentioned nowhere in the Article, and the reporter was and remains unfamiliar with sera Jacicus' connection to them.) She said, ''Now, I've dismissed you. Off you go.''\nThe reporter repeated  that if any damage had been done, it had been done by Jacicus' actions. The Truth is not wrong. The reporter also offered the opinion that Jacicus could not send them away from a public room.\n\nJacicus suggested that the reporter send a missive to Dame Umichan and ''tell her that.'' She growled, ''My rank gives me permission to do that.''\nThe reporter agreed that they were to contact the Captain in any case (in order to arrange something to facilitate communication of news and giving of statements by the Guard). The reporter asked Jacicus of her rank, as he believed her to be a Deputy of the Gaol (upon the ninth link). (However, further fact-checking reveals Jacicus is only listed as a member of the Company of Royal Players Corps upon the Great Chain, also upon the ninth link, and nowhere else upon it.)\n\nJacicus asserted that she was of the eighth link, and lived in the Inner Bailey.\nThe reporter asserted that they were aware of no document that stated this gave Jacicus any authority to issue commands. The reporter also inquired if Jacicus had been made a courtier.\n\nShe responded that she was no courtier, but that her ''rank is still higher than yours. I still get asked for leave, simply put.''\nThe reporter maintained their stance.\n\nJacicus said that the reporter has a lot to learn. (True of any person, certainly; the quest for Truth is never over.)\nThe reporter opined with confidence that honesty and loyalty to the Truth would be a sufficient shield and support.\n\nAfter a short silence, Jacicus stated that she had better things to do, and left.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA Yeoman was consulted by the reporter immediately afterwards, and it was confirmed that there was nothing limiting the postings of a person upon the public boards, as long as they be lawful (not treasonous or inflammatory). It was also confirmed that mere rank did not give authority to issue orders over others, irrespective of professional relationships. And it will please all to know that the Happenings have contacted the Captain of the Royal Guard to arrange for smooth transfer of information.\n\nThe Happenings apologises to any and all who feel that this article smacks of self-aggrandizement, but it was felt upon this occasion, it was necessary to make news of the news, as it were. It shall certainly not become a habit, and will be avoided as carefully as possible. However, when the Truth is besieged, those who cherish it must stand up to defend it.\n\n\nMuse Parade\n\nThe Friends of the Muse are planning to hold a parade in the Outer Bailey in the near future, and are looking for anyone interested in helping plan it.\n\nThe parade will last no less than two days, says ser Trisan, of the Friends of the Muse. Treats will be thrown, and other denizens are going to be involved through ''special methods'', yet to be specified.\n\n\nUpcoming Gala\n\nHis Lordship, Lord Gracien, is hosting a Winter Gala on the 11th Day (Saturn's Day) of this moon. Some eighty invitations have been sent out.\n\n\nNew Arrivals\n\nNew arrivals in the Castle today include: sera Jo (short for Johanna).",

I only know that 'tis fairly common knowledge that he holds sway over the winter here. When he is upset, the winds get worse.''\n\n\nSquire's Challenge\n\nThe opening ceremony for the Squire's Challenge was held yesterday evening, at the ninth bell, in the Inner Bailey courtyard; followed by a feast in the Royal Ballroom. This had been announced by Sir Bragi, a Knight of the Realm, well in time, on these public boards.\n\nEntrants include sera Keyana, sponsored by His Highness the Prince; ser Nexian, sponsored by Sir Bragi; and ser Osric, sponsored by Sir Vestio. Sponsorship is required for a candidate to be accepted into the challenge.\n\nAccording to the announcement: ''On the coming days following this ceremony, the Squire Hopefuls will have their mind, body and souls tested to the fullest.'' The details of the challenge are apparently to be kept secret, but those candidates that perform well at these challenge may be made Squires.\n\n\nFeast in Dining Hall\n\nTonight there was a veritable feast of fine foods laid out in the dining hall of the Outer Bailey, including pies, pork medallions, fine cheeses, fruits, cakes, and cookies. According to sera Xewe, these were the leftovers of the feast that had been held in the Inner Bailey as part of the opening ceremony of the Squire's Challenge. (See above article.)\n\nTwo guests present in the hall and enjoying the foods - giving their names as sera Mona Duret and ser Lauran Tian - related to the Happenings a more fantastical story: that the foods had been delivered by ''the Food Fairy'', whose sera Mona suggested might be Cookie Dumpling (though she was uncertain as to where she had heard the name). Ser Lauran suggested that the food fairy may have been trapped in a book, mentioned in a recent announcement by the Lord Chamberlain's office. He also speculated as to this supposed fairy's possible vindictiveness against whoever had imprisoned her in the book. The existence of any such fairy remains unconfirmed at this time, and the Happenings wishes to express that while we remain open to all possibilities so as to not miss the truth because of personal prejudice, we do not embrace such theories and ideas without first looking into them and finding some manner of proof, and that we are more inclined to consider as fact more level-headed theories.\n\n\nAgigated Acolyte\n\nAn Acolyte was behaving alarmingly in the dining hall this night, growling, wiping his bloody hands on his clothes; the sera who was with him seemed concerned, and was attempting to calm him down. When asked for his name, the Acolyte replied, ''At the moment, it is mud, because all anyone does is step all over me, and then wipe me from their boots.'' He spoke of death, and sera Xewe - who was present - asked if she should fetch her sword. The Acolyte seemed receptive to this idea. Sera Xewe walked up to him and slapped him in the face, and commented, ''If you believe that people walk over you then they will. Now if you wish to cut yourself, I will go get my sword, but none of this self-pity.'' This seemed to calm the Acolyte down, and he allowed the sera who accompanied him to lead him out for a breath of fresh air.\n\nWhen asked for a quote, sera Xewe volunteered: ''The Acolyte has been having a hard time and needed a slap to bring him to his senses.''\n\n\nNew Arrivals\nNew arrivals in the Castle include: ser Jimm Hedfield, sera Katryn.",

The page, sera Xewe, was sent to fetch ser Daris to facilitate the cleaning of the chute. They were accompanied by Acolyte Finna,  Yeoman Dannion, sera Corenia, sera Peraine, and ser Trisan, and joined at the site by ser Arian.\n\nDescribes ser Trisan: ''We entered that north door, to find a worker tending the coals. We entered the east door to find the slide of the chute overcrowded with the pile rubbish.''\n\nThey party even found a janitor stuck in the mounds of junk; he was dug out by sera Xewe, and reportedly found to be alive and healthy. They began throwing items into the ovens and the incinerator, finding food, drinks, scrolls, garments, and the like. Eventually, they had cleared enough room for the slide to function again, so they left and headed into the baths to clean up.\n\nAccording to ser Trisan, the party also found ''Rare garments, rare jewelry, invitations to old events, pairs of scissors, a worn desk, stuff like that.'' He opined that the desk, for one, had been in the room for some time, and remarked that it was not near the pile. Acolyte Finna even found a plain stiletto among the rubbish. Sera Peraine added that a piece of clothing made of glassweave (a material limited to nobility), which was thrown into the incinerator.\n\nSer Daris is referred to in older postings and an old chronicle as an Apprentice to the Royal Commissary, Master Quilp, and is apparently the author of one or more books regarding swordsmanship and other martial matters. He was apparently awoken some years prior to the Recent Awakenings. Ser Daris held the keys that were required to open the doors into the trash chute.\n\nSera Peraine's recounting of the events was in a different style, as she improvised the following poem for the Happenings:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAmidst a high and reeking mound,\nFilled with trash and refuse,\nSome precious clothes and jewels were found,\nBy those who would peruse.\n\nYet with more rubbish still to pick,\nWe did unstop the chute;\nLike vengeful pirates, bold and quick,\nWe did plunder, burn and loot.\n\nDirty then, we took our baths,\nAnd now we surely boast:\nThat we disposed of all the trash...\nOr at least, we picked up most.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs it is possible that some have misconstrued the purpose of the party cleaning the trash chute, it should be asserted here that - according to what was related to the Happenings - they did act under orders of the Lord Chamberlain, and apparently (though this remains conjecture) under the guidance of a member of the Armory, ser Daris, being that he was specifically requested to attend by the Lord Chamberlain, and possessed keys into the furnace and trash chute. Further details may be sought out from those who were present.\n\n\nJournalists Wanted\nBecome A Correspondent\n\nThe Happenings needs journalists and correspondents, as a single person can not even begin to cover the entirety of the Castle's daily events.\n\nEverything is news!\n\nJournalists:\n- Should be willing to send in articles regularly, on no less than a weekly basis;\n- Should be of an inquiring, truth-seeking mind, and able to maintain neutrality;\n- Will be credited for their articles;\n- Can write about anything current and topical.\n\nCorrespondents:\n- Should choose one area or subject on which to correspond regularly, on no less than a weekly basis;\n- Should have some connection to that area or subject;\n- Will be credited for their articles;\n- Are encouraged to write specifically about the affairs, meetings, and events of their one chosen group, preferrably attending such meetings and events to cover them.\n\nAll submissions will be edited for length, grammar, spelling, and content; and correspondents may be relieved that they need not spend all their time worrying about such. The facts will be retained, but unless the article is strictly an opinion piece, opinions and blatant interpretations will be edited out.\n\nWe want the Truth!\n\nWe are also looking for a capable sketch artist, willing to stand by to cover, possibly on very short notice, matters, sketching people, scenes, items, or places; charcoal or ink sketches only, to be copied twice.\n\nLastly, anonymous tips and leads of news are accepted, and will be investigated as time allows.

Interested parties should contact Muse guildmistress Ennah.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\"><b>Follow-Up - Consort&apos;s Portrait Burnt</b></span><br>\n<b>Correction</b><br>\n<br>\nIn edition VII of the happenings, we incorrectly reported that the Lord Marshal and the new Corporal discovered a picture of the Winter Knight in the Winter Watch office to have been vandalized; it was, in fact, His Excellency the Winter Knight himself, accompanied by the Corporal, who discovered the portrait."

A sharp crack came from the eastern staircase wall, into which the new fountain is set. A faint glow enveloped the fountain, and the images - lance, claw, and feather - in the basin flickered and faded repeatedly.\n\nSergeant Howe, one of those present, commented: ''Her Majesty said they would only last for so long. Was it a fortnight?''\n\nThe entire courtyard then shuddered briefly. (No one fell or was injured.) The fountain shimmered again, then seemed to return to normal. The wind seemed to pick up, and people thought they heard something on the wind; some thought it was a sigh. With a final flicker of pale blue and white light, the images in the fountain's basin faded from view, leaving nothing but water in the fountain.\n\nThe consensus among observers was that the magic of the fountain had dispersed. The images had created pendants - miniature lances, claws, or feathers in small crystals - for those who touched them. With this, there will be no more pendants.\n\nThe fountain was commissioned by Her Majesty in memory of the Wyvern War.\n\nSer Arikon Convicted\nStripped of Rank\n\nOn Sun's Day, ser Arikon was tried before the Lord Chancellor himself for Bloody Assault. According to the Prosecution, ser Arikon cut the hand of a then recently-awoken ser in a scuffle several moons ago.\n\nSer Arikon was found guilty, and is reportedly to be beheaded.\nNo official announcement of the trial's result has been made since it was held.\n\nSer Arikon was also stripped of his rank of honored guest, as punishment for his conduct during the trial. He made claims that Sir Alrik had given him permission to keep a sword (likely the same sword used in the commission of the actions he was charged for) acquired as loot from the elves in the Wyvern War. The claim was rejected by the Court of Justice, though Sir Alrik himself was not present at the trial to refute or confirm ser Arikon's claim. Elven swords were not on the list of items that could be claimed as loot.\n\nOpined sera Rikka of the matter: 'I think Arikon was stupid for pulling out a sword just to act like a tough guy. The whole thing could have been avoided if he wasn't quite so macho (sic).' (Macho was explained as 'tough'.)\n\nFaith Induction\n\nSera Corenia Golianor was inducted as a Seeker of the Faith on Sun's Day. Acolyte-Natura Finna held the induction, with Acolyte-Natura Sanc also present. Others attended. The induction was held at nine and a half late bells on Sun's Day (7th); afterwards the participants retired to the Cupola to hold the usual Sun's Day Seeker meeting. According to Seeker Xewe, Seekers were asked to keep an eye out for ghosts after the meeting. Details of Faith meetings remain confidential.\n\nUpcoming Battler Tournament\n\nAccording to ser Gareth, Preceptor of the Battle Guild, the Battlers intend to host a tournament of arms in the near future. ''We have not made up the formal plans, but we hope to invite all the Castle to participate, especially the other martial guilds,'' ser Gareth says.\n\nNew Arrivals\nNew arrivals in the Castle include sera Lyriss.",

He left, returned, and started telling people to hit him. He hit himself, and kept repeating the request to be hit by others, saying he had done a bad thing.\n\nSer Nexian told the man no one wished to hit him, and then asked that the man take his antics elsewhere. The man repeated his demand to be hit, then stepped to ser Nexian and struck him. Ser Nexian ordered the fellow to take his leave, lest he be forced to take action to remove the man from the courtyard. At this, the man laughed, and reportedly declared that he had tried to force himself upon a female acquaintaince. One of the women present blew a duckcall, and a Yeoman arrived, but the man had run from the sound of the call. He returned briefly, but ran off again. The Happenings was told that the man was later arrested on charges Public Nuisance and Assault upon a Yeoman.\n\nThe Happenings was unable to acquire a description of the man.

His time of death is estimated as yesterday morning (Tiu's Day, 9th). It is suspected that poison was involved; it is not uncommon for people to venture into the secret passages and return afflicted with a poison. Ser Zietn has been returned to life already, and has reportedly made some unofficial accusations regarding the circumstance of his death. Details remain muddled.\n\nTwo recent chroniclers describe circumstances surrounding ser Zietn's previous death, apparently of poison. According to witnesses interviewed for one chronicle, ser Zietn has ventured into the ill-reputed \"Under-Bailey\" more than once, and may have been poisoned by traps in the dark corridors before.\n\nAny knowledge of the matter should be reported to the Royal Guard.\n\n\nUpcoming Art Show\n\nThe Friends of the Muse will be holding an art show on the 26th Day of this Moon, at six late bells in the theater here in the Outer Bailey. Food and music will be provided, and formal attire is suggested.

          "text": "Saturn's Day, 13th Day, 8th Moon, 6th YRA\n\nMadman Attacks Four\n\"No Danger,\" Says Watch!\n\nA madman named Hargan terrorised several people in the Outer Bailey this morning. Anyone who has had a run-in with the man, or who has information pertaining to his actions and crimes, should contact the Royal Guard directly.\n\nHargan is a tall, lean man, with tanned skin and long light-brown hair worn loose. He was wearing plain clothes: a tunic, socks, a shirt, and pants.\n\nSometime between the fourth and fifth early bells, sera Nickieda entered the Outer Bailey courtyard, holding her wrist as if it were hurt, followed by the man Hargan. Others present were Mistress Avaria, sera Helena, sera Rikka, ser Crispian, and ser Lucus. Noticing sera Nickieda's injury, Mistress Avaria blew a healer whistle, but reported that none were awake to hear it.\n\nAccording to sera Nickieda, Hargan had earlier spoken of \"murderous acts and violence\" in public areas, and she had reproached him. He had sought her out in the refectory, seemingly to offer an apology, but then proceeded to attack her angrily and violently. Following instructions posted by Guard members on public boards, sera Nickieda fought off her attacker and made her way to the Courtyard. She says she injured her hand \"on his face.\"\n\nAccording to sera Rikka, Hargan has been causing trouble for days. Sera Nickieda opined: \"If someone is obviously going to be a threat and has repeatedly used such verbage and offended numerous denizens, there should be some sort of law allowing detainment just because of the potential harm they could do.\"\n\nSera Nickieda said that she had spoken to Armswoman Briseis of the Winter Watch about Hargan, and had been assured that he was not physically dangerous - despite the facts that Hargan has previously attacked sera Rikka, and attempted to do harm to others, is obviously insane, and has ranted about violence and murder in public. It seems the Watch was wrong.\n\n\nUnder Disorderly Conduct [3.2.04], the Capitulary Law states that \"If any person shall commit disorderly conduct, let them be exposed for no more than 5 days in the stocks, or suffer no more than 7 days imprisonment.\" Denizens of the Castle may wonder at what exactly constitutes Disorderly Conduct, if not insane and violent behavior in public. Surely the aim of the Watch and Guard is to protect denizens from harm, rather than merely seek out the guilty and see them punished.\n\nIt is supposedly common knowledge that no one may be arrested or charged with a crime, unless an actual physical crime has happened; this, however, is plainly incorrect information, being that the Capitulary Law includes charges for Disorderly Conduct, Making False Accusations, Inflammatory Statements, Bewitchment, Treason, and Misprision of Treason. The physicality of the action is clearly not a determining factor in whether or not it is a crime. Furthermore, speaking and shouting are certainly actions of a physical nature.\n\n\nHargan made off, declaring, ''You will not get me!'' He returned almost immediately, however, and charged at sera Nickieda. Mistress Avaria and sera Rikka stepped in, and a briefly scuffle followed, where sera Nickieda and Mistress Avaria were assaulted, and Hargan was briefly subdued. Mistress Avaria instructed sera Nickieda to make for her room, which she did, but Hargan followed her into the south stairwell. Mistress Avaria followed them both, and helped sera Nickieda get away from her persistent attacker, who made off with haste. Mistress Avaria located sera Nickieda again, and advised her firmly against remaining out. Said the perturbed sera Nickieda, ''I genuinely thought he wished to apologise and speak on courtesy.'' This casts in doubt Hargan's later claims of having perceived sera Nickieda as a ''black snake'' - certainly he would not have apologised and made pretense to converse if those claims were true.\n\nHargan continued to run about the Castle. Mistress Avaria, sera Peraine, and ser Crispian came across ser Dannion, Yeoman of the Royal Guard, and pointed Hargan out to him. Sera Peraine related that Hargan had attacked sera Rikka earlier, and had menaced her. Yeoman Dannion went off in pursuit, but was apparently unable to find and capture the criminal. Sera Peraine related her story to the Happenings: Hargan had tried to strangle sera Rikka, who fought him off successfully. Hargan had then pursued sera Peraine, and advanced on her menacingly - ''as if to grab me,'' she said. She eluded the man and fled from him.\n\n\nMistress Avaria, sera Peraine, and ser Crispian encountered Hargan again, in the corridor at the north end of the Art Gallery. Hargan was questioned by ser Crispian, and replied with nonsense and gibberings about a ''black snake''; he claimed to have seen it in place of sera Nickieda, and attempted to kill it. He threatened ser Crispian, saying he would, ''like to smash you down here'', and ''knock you down and throw you out of a window.'' He showed no concern for the immorality and illegality of his intended actions. He attacked ser Crispian, grabbing his throat and attempting to choke him. Mistress Avaria managed to push him away, and blew her duckcall, causing Hargan to flee the scene - but only briefly. He returned soon, and attempted to throttle Mistress Avaria similarly. The Mistress, however, struggled free, as ser Crispian hit the man upon the head with a heavy satchel. Hargan persisted, grabbing her hands, but was finally knocked out by another blow to the head from the satchel.\n\nMistress Avaria led sera Peraine and ser Crispian to the safety of the Chroniclers' room in the Bell Tower.\n\nIn less than two hours, Hargan - declared ''not dangerous'' by the Watch, and deemed not to be disruptive or disorderly enough to be arrested - had tried to kill three people - sera Nickieda, ser Crispian, and Mistress Avaria.\n\n\nScream Scares Courtyard\nLast evening, at or around ten late bells, a terrible scream was heard echoing from the Inner Bailey all the way into the Outer Bailey. Master Johnathan, Armswoman Briseis, sera Rikka, and ser Lucus attempted to find the source of the scream, but were unable to find out anything.\n\nIt is speculated that this scream may have been related to the Squire's Challenge, as apparently ser Nexian - one of the candidates - fought a Fae Knight last evening. Ser Nexian is reportedly wounded but alive.\n\n\nNew Arrivals\nNew arrivals today in the Castle include: ser Jerrick.",

Royal Player Scaramouche, present in the Inner Bailey Courtyard at the time said shout occured, did rush to the Ballroom to find Royal Player Sansamor lying motionless on the floor. After some investigation, it was concluded that Royal Player Sansamor had passed.  Master Davog then reportely hissed at those present before fleeing to the stables.\n\nRoyal Player Scaramouche didst then give pursuit while Mistress Zenaida stayed with the body of Sansamor. Once in the stables, it is reported to this chronicler that Master Davog acted in a fashion most unlike himself and that his features were darkly contorted and his eyes glowed a strange shade of green, described as malevolant in appearance. According to witnesses present, the Master did then appear to grin and said only 'Sorry Mortals, but it is time for me to leave'. He waved his hand as if preparing to leave the room, when his body at once fell lifeless and a mist appeared to rise from it floating about the room seemingly by its own volition. Master Davog's body then shriveled to seeming dust and disappeared without a trace. No body has since been recovered.\n\nThis Chronicler has investigated all accounts of this event, and can offer nothing more than what has been stated here. Many theories have been  mentioned with regards to Master Davog's seeming behaviour by those closest to him who report that he has only ever been the most courteous of souls, and that such actions are not in line with what is known to be his character. This Chronicler will not scribe with regards to rumours, but will let the attestment with regards to those who knew him best, stand.\n\nIn addition, this Chronicler begs forgiveness on this day for any error in this missive regarding this incident, and beseeches any that should know of such to contact me personally that we might speak of it at once with absolute assurances of privacy as is deemed needful. \n\nIn service of the Lord Chamberlain, \n\nSorcha Du D�nan \nChronicler of the Court",

And don't forget to take part in our upcoming contest and haircare lecture for Guild Week!\nWhat is Courtesy?\nWrit by Mistress Sinvy, Patron of the Courtesy Circle\nCourtesy is the excellence of manners and social conduct. As a Virtue in which we live by it states that each ~guest~ of Her Majesty is worthy of regard and simple respect. It also implies through action that you believe the individual you are interacting with is an honourable and upstanding guest.\n\nThe most difficult tests of Courtesy come when faced with discourtesy and comfort. It is easy to lose ones temper and act in a manner which is unacceptable, thereby lowering your standards and disregarding Courtesy, but it is also easy to lose sight of Courtesy when faced with comfort zones, such as close friends or loved ones. \n\nI would ask you to consider the following when handling situations of discourtesy or comfort; you dislike the manner in which you are being treated, so why would you treat someone in such a manner? Likewise, you value your friends and loved ones, so why degrade them in public by disregarding their station, the honorifics that define them from those who would shun the civility of society? If you are faced publicly with discourtesy, politely request of the individual that the issue be taken up in private. If they refuse such, you are perfectly able to disregard their actions and words (unless physical in which case you utilize a duckcall) and handle it in another acceptable way; through issue of challenge or seeking out their superiors or betters. If you are an Honored Guest and are friends with a Courtier, you treat your friend with the respect due to their station as a Courtier of Her Majesty's Court and not like your equal or lesser. You would hardly disrespect someone you allegedly value by calling them pet names in public or playing with them in manners which are best reserved for private gatherings.\n\nCourtesy is not just being mindful of yourself, but others. It is considered discourteous to deliberately press issues that we know should be handled in private or that we know make some present uncomfortable. In many cases, being mindful of yourself and others will keep you from unintentionally taking advantage of another's courtesy who feels it improper or feels poorly for leaving an area due to one inconsiderate person. This is a good example of showing too much Courtesy. Those who are too Courteous may be trod upon and their nature taken advantage of. Similarly, another facet of being too Courteous is that you become dishonest. Courtesy is not about falsifying information given, but about curbing how much honesty is shared.\n\nAn example of such, if someone inquires as to how you are and you are poorly. You may merely state you have been better, as opposed to entering into the intimate details of why you are poorly, who made you so and so forth. These is best reserved for private intercourse rather than public.\n\nThe above is an example of how everyday Courtesy is still a complex interaction. Further, I would say that basic acknowledgment is disregarded and done perfunctorily as opposed to done with thought and care. Many people do disregard the common greetings of bowing, curtsying and nodding as thoughtless actions. However, these simple actions speak volumes if you know how to pay attention. Primarily these actions state that you believe those you are acknowledging are worthy of respect and that you believe them to be courteous individuals. You also state with these actions that you too are worthy of respect and hold Courtesy as a Virtue worth following.\n\nIn short, Courtesy is the foundation upon which civilized societies are built and everyone is worthy of it in its most basic forms.\nGuild Week!\nComing this 10th day of the 4th moon, Guild Week promises endless bells of informative activities hosted by the various guilds around the castle.\n\nGuild Week Schedule:The main schedule\n\nContests:Toy Design by the Carpenters\nHairstylist Contest & Seminar\nRose Art Contest (not limited to Guild Week)\n\nGuild Rosters\nBelow is an updated list of guild rosters, provided by the Chambers.

There are two common misconceptions about the purpose and attitude relating to Courtesy. The first is that being courteous makes you a ''snob'' and that those who are courteous are ''snobs''. The second being that being courteous means you must be friendly or friends with an individual.\n\nThe first misconception and the second tend to tie together more often than not. Someone who practices the virtue of Courtesy and therefore is courteous is in no way a snob, they are acting in a manner befitting a civilized being according to the established virtues of the society in which we live in now. Likewise, just because someone educates another in Courtesy, be it through example or direct verbal and written education does not make them a snob or mean they are being rude to you. There have been many times where I have heard or seen someone get upset or flat out angry because someone - no matter how politely - corrected them or acted correctly.\n\nAn example of such would be to individuals in the pillory or on distraint. It is not rude or inappropriate for someone to disregard these individuals as they are -beneath contempt- and have eschewed Her Majesty's generosity by refusing to follow the Law in which She has laid down for the benefit of everyone. Therefore, it is socially frowned upon to coddle these individuals, friend or not, because to encourage the breaking of the law endangers the whole of the population and Society.\n\nThe second misconception that seems to run rampant is that to be courteous one must be friendly. This is most certainly -not- the case. No where in our society does one imply the other and to assume such is considered inappropriate. Courtesy does not require that one smile, hug, nickname, inquire about the weather or even invite people to join them for cake. It does require that betters be acknowledged by lessers and that people adhere to the basic respect afforded to all individuals not under arrest or held outside of Her Majesty's good graces.\n\nI have often heard chatter about how rude an individual was, only to learn that they had simply not been bursting with enthusiasm, being in possession of a bubbling disposition or in the mood to socialize with and coddle their peers or lessers. While I can see how this could be off putting for the majority of our population, it is always important to remember that not everyone is or even wishes to be friends with everyone else, and that because they choose this path does not make them discourteous, but merely makes them human.\n\nIn short, being courteous to others does not make you a snob, it means you are bettering your character by pursuing one of the society's key virtues and just because someone is courteous does not mean they are expected to be your friend or have to act as if they are. The Courtesy Circle asks that you keep these in mind when interacting with your peers and betters and try not to cultivate perceptions that are incorrect and impede your own virtue.\nGuild Rosters\nBelow is an updated list of guild rosters, provided by the Chambers.

This is simply untrue and, in many cases, a very frustrating notion.\n\nThe purpose of the Office of the Chronicler is not to entertain, but rather to enlighten. Our ultimate goal is the preservation of history, warts and all, to inform the Crown of the going-ons of the castle, and to provide a clear picture of recent events to the denizenry. If a chronicle in question ends up being \"boring\", at fault is the Chronicler's pen, not the unfolding of events or the people involved. Granted, there may be times when two events unfold simultaneously and the Chronicler is forced to devote attention to one over the other. For example: ser Overlydramatic makes a scene in the courtyard about how sera Promiscuity was, shockingly, unfaithful to him, and all the while Lord Daftsense publically declares that all members of his household must now wear pants on their heads.\n\nWhen faced with such a choice, the Chronicler will usually do everything in their power to gather notes and information on both events, often recruiting the aid of a colleague, Page, or other trusted individual to bear witness to one of the two unfolding events and collect notes. If the chronicle of ser Overlydramatic is published before that of Lord Daftsense, the reasons for the delay are administrative, not an indication of the Chronicler's personal preference or to imply that the pinings of a commoner are considered more significant than the declarations of a Lord. The delay may be that the Chronicler received conflicting reports and must now investigate further, or perhaps they are simply awaiting the testimony of an individual whose presence is rare and unpredictable.\n\nThat something should go un-reported by a Chronicler is unfortunate, and generally due to the limitation of the Office's resources and manpower. Quite simply, if something happens, as things are wont to do, it is worthy of a Chronicler's attention.\n\nA Call for Common Courtesy\nWrit by Regan le Marechal, Assistant Guildmistress of the Courtesy Circle\nIt is with great discontent that reports of unseemly behavior, contrary to the Virtues that act as the foundation of Her Majesty�s societal values, continue to arise from within the Outer Bailey. It seems, however, that out of all of the Honor Virtues one is most absent in the Outer; Courtesy. Before readers begin to form theories about guilty parties, they will certainly benefit to know two things; the first is that those who are seen demonstrating ill-adjusted behaviors are not, solely ex-criminals, ex-rebels, and persons with shady pasts. In fact, it can be argued that the majority of the discourteous Outer denizens are none of these things. The second item is that these concerns being voiced, while too exist within the Inner, are coming from common folk who reside in the Outer Bailey themselves; this article is a collective voice for the gentles who call the Outer home.\n\nA handful of familiarly regardless denizens continue to unleash their impropriety on their peers, and even their superiors; barely acknowledging others whom share their station, and using disgracefully informal gestures to greet their betters in public. Intrusive entrances that disrupt conversations, social events, and meetings are all-too-common, and terribly rude. A few persons choose to coddle convicts� ruthless individuals who act in heinous offenses against the Crown and Court, and whom are below contempt; they mistake their own blatant ignorance of Her Majesty�s will for kindness. There is also a theme among these select few delinquents, of disrespect toward authority, jurisdiction, and titles that are given to deserving and loyal subjects to exercise the Laws of Marrach. This is certainly one of the most outrageous acts of discourtesy that the fine folk of the Outer are forced to witness; relentless disregard for Her Majesty�s Offices of Law.\n\nWhether these behaviors result from a passive approach to life and the Virtues, or they are a flagrant act of disrepute, they are not being met with acceptance. Those denizens of the Outer Bailey, who choose to live their lives in accordance to the healthy social standards set by Her Majesty�s Court and Castle, are raising their demands to counter the discourtesy they are being forced to live with. No longer will they allow their own reputations to be tarnished by the poor choices of some; no more will they abstain from action against this assault on Courtesy; no longer will they keep silent. Discount for this and the other Honor Virtues overshadows the efforts made by so many to live demonstratively, and with good will. Poor manners, disgusting language, unseemly public displays, and sheer ignorance all translate harmful messages about the Outer Bailey�s residents to the Court, the Royal Family, and new guests of Her Majesty. Partaking in and being passive about these concerns both perpetuate a negative cycle of indecorous, uncouth, and disruptive patterns in Outer society.\n\nThe fair and reputable denizens who reside Outer have expressed the changes that they desire from their inconsiderate peers. They are small, yet exceptionally important changes that would not only satisfy guests within the Outer, but also please those of higher rank. These are things that everyone should, by Virtue, adhere to;\nFor all acts based in Courtesy, and the Honor Virtues, be it a bow or a greeting, to be acknowledged and responded to by equals and betters.\nFor disruptive, private, and/or inappropriate conversations to be taken out of social settings, and continued beyond the public eye.\nFor those who have been asked to cease a certain behavior, or perhaps to vacate an area or function as a result of their behavior, to do so without resistance.\n* For all titles, whether Guildmistress, Instructor, or Page, to be properly acknowledged and used appropriately in social situations by equals and betters.\nThat the themes of respect, tact, and grace be not only for those who reside Inner, but that they may also exist and thrive among those who reside Outer.\nAnd finally, that all persons demonstrate due deference to those within Her Majesty�s Offices of Justice; be it the Inquest, Watch, Guard, or Prosecution.\n\n\n* A note: during every day conversation and greeting, a Page may be referred to as either �Page�, �Page Goodman�, or �ser Goodman�. However, while on duty, or discussing official business, it is appropriate to use �Page� in or as Goodman�s address, and not �ser�. The same can be said about other officially recognized Court and Civil positions, such as Scribe or Aide. In the case of a Guild or Group leader; they should socially be referred to as sera Ladylike and ser Gentleman unless discussing official business, or being introduced in a setting where their position holds relevance. While operating in a leadership capacity, such as holding a lecture or hosting a social, they should be referred to by members and guests alike by their affiliate titles, such as Guildmistress Ladylike and Director Gentleman; the same can be said about Teachers, Instructors, Patrons, and other prominent members of Outer Groups and Guilds. As a personal choice, subordinates of Guild and Group leaders may chose to refer to their superiors as Guildmistress Ladylike and Director Gentleman outside of official matters, but this is a personal decision left to individual discretion, and is not required by the standards of Courtesy.\n\nIt is very possible for persons to act discourteously without knowing that their actions are considered thus. In these and all cases of offense against the Virtues, it is important that denizens of the Outer Bailey practice open and diplomatic dialogue with their peers; however, it is stressed to always do so in a respectful and civilized manner. Criticisms, for the most part, are best handled in private; if this is unfeasible, then they should be performed with the utmost care and consideration, as the point is to encourage proper behavior and not to humiliate. It is understood by the Courtesy Circle that sometimes addressing a person in regards to their words, actions, or inactions may be a stressful or unpleasant situation; in these circumstances, denizens are encouraged to write to a Leader within the Courtesy Circle with their concerns. Circle Leaders and Members may act as a buffer between those who have caused offense, and those who have suffered, going so far as keeping the latter anonymous if it is seen as an appropriate and or necessary action.",

It is understood by the Courtesy Circle that sometimes addressing a person in regards to their words, actions, or inactions may be a stressful or unpleasant situation; in these circumstances, denizens are encouraged to write to a Leader within the Courtesy Circle with their concerns. Circle Leaders and Members may act as a buffer between those who have caused offense, and those who have suffered, going so far as keeping the latter anonymous if it is seen as an appropriate and or necessary action.<br>\n</div></span>"

          "text": "THE CLOCK TOWER HERALD\nIssue IV\n16th Day, 5th Moon, 12th Year of these Recent Awakenings\n\n-------------------------------\n\nA collection of articles and information about current castle life and events, published every fortnight.\nIntroduction to the Virtues\nWrit by Dame Eeva, provided by Master Heath\nWhat are the honour Virtues? The Honour Virtues are a simplified code of expected social conduct decided upon by the uppermost ranks of the Society. The Virtues, while typically thought of to be a Knightly pursuit are infact a required code of conduct for all individuals within this society. While it is acknowledged that each individual awakened within these walls may very well come from cultures with an entirely different set of expectations, traditions, and patterns of social behaviour, it is expected that upon entering into this society and choosing to remain within it, one makes the effort to learn the accepted code of conduct within the society.\n\nThe acknowledged and favored Honour Virtues of the Court are as follows:\n\nCourtesy\nLoyalty\nCourage\nJustice\nFranchise\nFortitude\nProwess\nHonesty\nMercy\nGallantry\nCharity\n\nSome have asked in the past ''Where is honour amongst the Honour Virtues?''. The answer is quite simple. Honour -is- the Honour Virtues. By following these Virtues to the best of your ability, you are in essence acting honourably and with honour. This is why to dub someone without Honour is such a grievous claim, because it strips them of each and every Virtue.\n\nIn theory, no Virtue is more important than the others, instead they complement each other. However, within the Winter Court, there is a tendency to hold some above others. Courtesy for example, is the most valuable Virtue to possess within the Court. This does not mean that Charity is the least valuable and should be ignored, it simply means that Courtesy is more in demand amidst the Court.\n\nThroughout this book, I am going to write not about how these Virtues apply to Knights, but how they apply to Society as a whole.\n\nI will start with the very basics.\n\nWhat is a Virtue?\n\nQuite simply put, a virtue is a standard of moral excellence and goodness.\n\nWhy follow the Virtues?\n\nI say, why not? By definition Virtues are a good and desireable qualities to possess.\n\nHowever, for those who wish a less simplistic approach to it, the Virtues, or any Virtue is designed to enrich, protect and serve not just the individual, but the whole through forging moral principles. Nearly every culture has a set of Virtues that encompass basic fundamental qualities of Courtesy, Prowess and Justice. You could say that each great civilization began humbly with a simple set of Virtues, therefore making Virtues the building blocks of civilized society and interactions.\n\nWhat are the social and personal benefits of following the Virtues?\n\nAs stated prior, Virtues are the building blocks for polite and civilized society. By adhering a set of Virtues you are ensuring that all social interactions have the best interests of yourself, those you are socializing with and the society as a whole in mind. Because the Virtues do cover things like Courtesy, by sticking to this virtue you can ensure that you do not offend or are not offended by the actions of another, with Virtues such as Honesty and Justice, they ensure that if you -are- offended there is a clear and direct way to fix it with minimal discomfort to the parties involved. This is a very simple example, and more Virtues than the ones listed can be part of everyday interaction.\n\nBy acting in accordance with the basic Virtues you ensure that civilized interaction is maintained. Should you act in opposition to the virtues set up by the society you are residing in, it can and often does lead to chaos within the structure or at least unpleasantry for yourself. By lacking virtues you could easily be setting yourself up for such things as detainment for prolonged periods of time, needless grief upon yourself from others or even in extreme cases death.\n\nThis is the basic benefit of following and basic reason for following the Virtues.\n\nWhile one can follow the utmost basics of the Virtues, this is, in my opinion a waste. The Virtues as listed above are not only there to act as a guide for civilized society, but to enhance the character of those who follow them more thoroughly. Through pursuit of the Virtues you can enrich and improve your quality of life as each Virtue is a lesson in itself. By following and pursuing the Virtues one can more easily reflect upon their actions and draw inspiration from the Virtues to better their own nature as these are qualities that inherently make a person admirable and noble.\nCourtesy in Love and Romance\nWrit by Mistress Sinvy, Patron of the Courtesy Circle\nMuch of the time we must focus on the basics of Courtesy. How to bow, when to nod, why to curtsy and to whom and so forth. However, there is a topic within the layers of Courtesy that touches on one of the softer sides of human nature; Love and Romance.\n\nAffection is not limited to rank*, race or gender. It is a universal emotion felt by everyone to some degree. You may feel it toward a garment, toward an animal or toward a person, but it is felt. We shall be discussing human affection today.\n\nWhile the basics of Courtship Courtesy have been explored in previous Courtesy in a Nutshell editions, I wish explore how Courtship Courtesy and Fine Amour interact.\n\nThe art of Fine Amour is the decorous display of love and adoration from an appropriate distance. Fine Amour is the epitome of Courtly Romance, suitable to be practiced by all ranks. It is typically reserved for those who are unattainable, by being within a Courtship (not to be confused with Suiting), by being Wed or by being highly ranked. This does -not- mean it is exclusive as such.\n\nFine Amour at its core is the art of wooing and being wooed. This is an important part of interaction between a couple as it breeds deeper affection and more fulfilling romance. It is, to me, an essential component to any part of the Courtship process.\n\nIt plays its most important role during the process of Suiting and being Suited. There are a couple of reasons for this. During the process of suiting or being suited, you are trying to earn or gain the affection of someone through your own merits, deeds and so forth. This is -not- an assured victory to their heart, so you bear yourself to the individual without expectation of their romance. It is a pure display of the heart.\n\nThe ultimate goal, in most cases, of pressing suit is to win the heart of the individual you are pressing suit to. To quote from the Courtesy in a Nutshell on Courtship Courtesy;\n\n\"If a couple is only suiting the bare minimum of contact and privacy should be had as this is the friendly stage where you get to know each other mentally and emotionally. Escorting and the kissing of hands is acceptable. One should not linger overmuch in their direct presence or frequently vanish to unknown locations as this gives the impression that they are more than suiting.\"\n\nAs previously stated, Fine Amour and Pressing Suit are intertwined. You press suit to an individual without the expectation of reciprocation. In doing such, you enter into a state of play with the individual; you trying to win their heart and they are trying to deter you from or allow you to as they will. This is the proving grounds of Romance.\n\nThe appropriate actions of one pressing suit are to be courteous and respectful to the individual you are interested in and vice verse. This should be an action to anyone, but it becomes more intimate once you decide you wish to know someone better. You may grant unto them poetry, compliments, small gifts and may serve as escort** to them for social events. You must not crowd them, treat them as ''yours'' or be disrespectful of their personal space. If you are being suited, you may treat them as you please, so long as it is polite. You do not need to accept their gifts, nor are you expected to gift them in return, you may thank them for the poetry, and accept their escort.\n\nIn many cases, the affection and suit are reciprocated - eventually. However, in some cases the other party is merely uninterested. You may continue to press suit to the individual, but be careful it does not hinge on obsessive behaviour. If you are being suited by an individual or individuals that you do not care to get to know, wish them to cease and so forth, merely ask them. If they persist in a manner you find inappropriate or intimidating, it is then suggested you seek the Courtesy Circle, Winter Watch or Royal Guard as it has clearly turned into unacceptable attention.\n* It is limited to rank in how it may be pursued though.\n** Not an official escort if the individual is an un-Knighted member of Court.",

This is a very simple example, and more Virtues than the ones listed can be part of everyday interaction.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">B</span>y acting in accordance with the basic Virtues you ensure that civilized interaction is maintained. Should you act in opposition to the virtues set up by the society you are residing in, it can and often does lead to chaos within the structure or at least unpleasantry for yourself. By lacking virtues you could easily be setting yourself up for such things as detainment for prolonged periods of time, needless grief upon yourself from others or even in extreme cases death.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>his is the basic benefit of following and basic reason for following the Virtues.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>hile one can follow the utmost basics of the Virtues, this is, in my opinion a waste. The Virtues as listed above are not only there to act as a guide for civilized society, but to enhance the character of those who follow them more thoroughly. Through pursuit of the Virtues you can enrich and improve your quality of life as each Virtue is a lesson in itself. By following and pursuing the Virtues one can more easily reflect upon their actions and draw inspiration from the Virtues to better their own nature as these are qualities that inherently make a person admirable and noble.</div><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:48px\">C</span><span style=\"font-size:28px\">ourtesy in Love and Romance</span><br>\n<i>Writ by Mistress Sinvy, Patron of the Courtesy Circle</i><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">M</span>uch of the time we must focus on the basics of Courtesy. How to bow, when to nod, why to curtsy and to whom and so forth. However, there is a topic within the layers of Courtesy that touches on one of the softer sides of human nature; Love and Romance.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">A</span>ffection is not limited to rank*, race or gender. It is a universal emotion felt by everyone to some degree. You may feel it toward a garment, toward an animal or toward a person, but it is felt. We shall be discussing human affection today.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">W</span>hile the basics of Courtship Courtesy have been explored in previous Courtesy in a Nutshell editions, I wish explore how Courtship Courtesy and Fine Amour interact.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>he art of Fine Amour is the decorous display of love and adoration from an appropriate distance. Fine Amour is the epitome of Courtly Romance, suitable to be practiced by all ranks. It is typically reserved for those who are unattainable, by being within a Courtship (not to be confused with Suiting), by being Wed or by being highly ranked. This does -not- mean it is exclusive as such.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">F</span>ine Amour at its core is the art of wooing and being wooed. This is an important part of interaction between a couple as it breeds deeper affection and more fulfilling romance. It is, to me, an essential component to any part of the Courtship process.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">I</span>t plays its most important role during the process of Suiting and being Suited. There are a couple of reasons for this. During the process of suiting or being suited, you are trying to earn or gain the affection of someone through your own merits, deeds and so forth. This is -not- an assured victory to their heart, so you bear yourself to the individual without expectation of their romance. It is a pure display of the heart.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>he ultimate goal, in most cases, of pressing suit is to win the heart of the individual you are pressing suit to. To quote from the Courtesy in a Nutshell on Courtship Courtesy;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">&quot;I</span>f a couple is only suiting the bare minimum of contact and privacy should be had as this is the friendly stage where you get to know each other mentally and emotionally. Escorting and the kissing of hands is acceptable. One should not linger overmuch in their direct presence or frequently vanish to unknown locations as this gives the impression that they are more than suiting.&quot;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">A</span>s previously stated, Fine Amour and Pressing Suit are intertwined. You press suit to an individual without the expectation of reciprocation. In doing such, you enter into a state of play with the individual; you trying to win their heart and they are trying to deter you from or allow you to as they will. This is the proving grounds of Romance.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">T</span>he appropriate actions of one pressing suit are to be courteous and respectful to the individual you are interested in and vice verse. This should be an action to anyone, but it becomes more intimate once you decide you wish to know someone better. You may grant unto them poetry, compliments, small gifts and may serve as escort** to them for social events. You must not crowd them, treat them as &apos;&apos;yours&apos;&apos; or be disrespectful of their personal space. If you are being suited, you may treat them as you please, so long as it is polite. You do not need to accept their gifts, nor are you expected to gift them in return, you may thank them for the poetry, and accept their escort.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:20px\">I</span>n many cases, the affection and suit are reciprocated - eventually. However, in some cases the other party is merely uninterested. You may continue to press suit to the individual, but be careful it does not hinge on obsessive behaviour. If you are being suited by an individual or individuals that you do not care to get to know, wish them to cease and so forth, merely ask them. If they persist in a manner you find inappropriate or intimidating, it is then suggested you seek the Courtesy Circle, Winter Watch or Royal Guard as it has clearly turned into unacceptable attention.<br>\n<i><div style=\"margin-left:40px\">* It is limited to rank in how it may be pursued though.<br>\n** Not an official escort if the individual is an un-Knighted member of Court.</div></i></div><br>\n</span>"

Here, this publication presents just a few of the available guilds that one may join, whether a newly awoken guest of Her Majesty, or a long-established resident seeking to change their path.\n\n Below is a quick introduction to each guild, a basic list of requirements, and whom to contact for more information or to apply.Awakener, The Awakeners\n\n Awakeners are responsible for helping the new guests find clothes, answering their questions, teaching them basic courtesy, helping them find friends, and aiding them in finding their path within their new home.

The main purpose is to protect all of Her Grace's denizens from each other and the chaos that would ensue should anyone take matters into their own hands.\nFor instance, let us say someone known to be a repeat criminal is killed on the parapets. The dead criminal would nay simply be scoffed at and ignored by lawmen; the crime would be treated just as seriously as all others. It nay matters that they were/are a criminal, what matters is that they are a denizen of Her Grace, and as such are protected by the same laws as someone who has never committed a crime. In the eyes of the law they are treated equally. This goes for all crimes committed, Misdemeanor or High Crime. \n\n Lawmen themselves are nay above the laws they are sworn to uphold, and the punishment for breaking a law can easily be a dishonourable discharge in addition to what is already listed in the Capitulary. There is even a set of laws that specifically pertains to them. There are also exceptions, but nonetheless they are still held to each. \n\n Thus, the law itself is nay unfair in the least; it is actually what is keeping everyone safe, and that all denizens are entitled and held to.\n\n (Please note that \"denizens\" means those that live in the Outer and Inner baileys, and are nay currently exiled.)\n Her Majesty's Guests  \n From the Awakeners, here is an extensive list of the castle's newest guests.

All of our members hope that in some way we can foster the arts to prosper in Her Majesty's realm. The Unity hopes that we can also provide some entertainment to the denizens in the castle.

Some of these positions are listed on the Great Chain.\n\nThe Unity is sponsored by Her Majesty's Chatelaine, Lady Amoret, and is patronized by Sir Bragi (poetry) and sera Heulyn (dance and music). It is led by the Mistress of Entertainment, Mistress Ophidias, but the Outer Bailey contact is sera Tamora.\n\nMembers include Thespian Ezraella, Masques Dolph and Juliee, Mummers Kaylana, Harriet, Ambra and Gabriela, and Harlequins Lakish, Aline, Vaden, Auriela, Kaori and Breyan.\n\nEach member has different specialties of studies and interest in the Arts. Some past events that were held by the Unity are the Winter Ball, Ardor Week, Snowflake Serenade Ball, Women's Eve of Beauty, Gentlemen's Eve. This year, the Unity partnered with the Garden Society to bring forth the Ghost Ball for everyone to enjoy. It also holds socials on occasion of various themes to entertain the denizens.\nNudity and its place\nwrit by Lady SinvySince the beginning of human existence there has been nudity. The natural state of being is indeed, nude. The body is not born with garb, but garbed out of necessity; be it to keep warm, for protection, for ceremonial purposes or simply for fashion. In many cases, clothing becomes a societal norm to depict status and personal style. A manner in which we can express ourselves or which defines our role in this life and serves in practicality; such as preventing frost bite.\n\nNudity within our lives is often disregarded and labeled unnatural, scandalous and obscene. There are several reasons for this; people are uncomfortable with their physical body, jealous of others', have somehow been led to believe that it is naughty to look at the nude form, think about it, think about others, and they immediately associate nudity to acts of sexual intimacy and the majority associate - or seem to associate - the act of sexual intimacy to issues that lead to guilt and discomfort. The laying out of the human psyche surrounding nudity and guilt is interesting on a philosophical level, but it has no place in this article.\n\nIn an evolved culture, nudity has an exalted place amidst religious and artistic circles. The nude form has graced the walls of Monarchs, tombs of God-Kings, caves of simple men, parchment and tapestry alike. It has prayed before Gods, danced to banish evil, held messiahs in swaddling clothes and been sacrificed for the hope of prosperity.\n\nThe nude form, both male and female are not scandalous, naughty, obscene, unnatural or immoral to behold, revere, talk of, write of, or depict.\n\nThere is an exception; a societal exception. The Courtesy in the handling of nudity.\n\nAs with all topics that tend to draw controversial opinions for public discussion; blood and injuries, sexual forays, gossip of others, it is important that it be done decorously, professionally and sometimes discreetly. This is not to preserve their virtue, their modesty or anything else, this is simply because the topic is not vulgar and should not be treated in a disrespectful manner. In order for an Artist to become truly skilled at painting the figures of the human body, they - like medical personnel - must study the human body in its natural state; nude. You must comprehend how the body works, how the body flows, how bodies are different and how they are the same.\n\nThere is no shame in posing nude for the Arts, like there is no shame in taking a bath or changing clothes. There are social expectations, as well as personal expectations. Legally, you should not be nude in public. Does that prevent one from utilizing a public background in a painting? Not at all. One should not fornicate in the baths. Does this mean that every single person who has ever bathed with another individual is fornicating when in the baths? No, of course not. A modicum of Common Sense is required when handling the issue of nudity. Nudity is in some ways a very personal aspect of an individual. They should not be ridiculed if they do not wish to share their form. Likewise, an individual who behaves properly, but wishes to freely display their body for the Arts should not be ridiculed or scandalized either. If a painting is in poor taste - i.e.; raunchy - by societal and artistic standards, then that painting should remain discreet.\n\nA true connoisseur of the Arts knows this and holds a deep appreciation for the nude form and the artistry in which one displays it. There is a time and place for nudity and if it has no other place in the world, than it should hold a place in the Arts. They claim that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, that it is only skin deep, and many other cliche remarks of that nature, but the beauty of the nude form in Art lies within the curve of a brushstroke, the gentle palette of colors, the harsh lines of shadows and the imperfections of the model, not within the fact they are themselves nude. Nudity is merely an inspiration.",

Order yours today!\nGuild of the Month\nThis month The Clocktower Herald is profiling two organizations: The Winter Watch and the Duelists' Society. Normally, we would publish the piece delivered first into our hands, but in this case, they arrived simultaneously.\nThe Winter Watch\nThe Winter Watch is an office under Her Majesty's Chancery, responsible for upholding peace and order and administering the law in the Outer Bailey. Established many centuries ago by the Chancellor, Lord Boreas, it was led by Corporal Petris � since knighted � until recent years. Some years ago, the Watch was briefly re-organized as the Castle Sentry, but was eventually reformed back into the Winter Watch.\n\nThe Winter Watch is overseen by the Royal Provost, who holds an office in High Chancery. The internal ranks of the Watch are, in descending order, Corporal, Armsman, Watchman, and Deputy. Starting from Watchmen, members of the Winter Watch bear arms and are empowered and equipped to make arrests and question people, as well as dispense justice in cases of Misdemeanor crime.\n\nThe roster of the Watch is maintained by the Office of the Chamber on the Great Chain of Being. The current Royal Provost is Sir Priam and the Corporal is sera Blodwen. The Winter Watch is always looking for new deputies to be trained in combat and the administration of law, to serve and protect the Crown and the Queen's guests. Anyone interested and willing should contact the Corporal.\n\nIn its long history, the Winter Watch has produced many knights, both through the Royal Guard and through challenge and appointment, including Sir Anselm, Sir Alrik the Lord Marshal, Sir Petris, Sir Vestio, and Dame Eeva.\n\nService in the Winter Watch has also traditionally been a stepping-stone into the Royal Guard and protecting the Court, providing the Guard with experienced recruits already trained in the essentials of their duty.\n\nThe Duelists' Society\nThe Society of Duelists is a guild chartered to teach swordsmanship, the Code Duello, and the Chivalric Virtues, and to serve as champions, seconds, and advocates in affairs of honor, as well as to wield their weapons in defense of Crown and Castle. Duelists also act as Eleves to the Court of Honor.\n\nThe original Society was founded by sers Mark Trevayne and Edouard and sera Allenya, for the sanctioned study and teaching of the art of honorable dueling in the Outer Bailey, where at the time only the Winter Watch and certain individual teachers taught swordsmanship.\n\nThe current Society was chartered in the ninth Year of the Recent Awakenings, when on the twenty-fourth day of the tenth moon the first members � ser Serione and ser Donovon - took their oaths before Sir Launfal, the Chamberlain. The old Society had been disbanded, and the new Society was founded on a charter written from the ground up to ensure such a thing would never again occur.\n\nThe Society is sponsored by His Royal Highness, Prince Bertram, Master of the Court of Honor, and currently patronized by Master Varick, squire to His Royal Highness. The Duelists are led by a Triad of Seniors, who among them vote and decide on daily issues; but the Society is one of equals, and matters of importance are brought to a vote before the entire Society. The current members of the Triad are sers Donovon, Serione and Skorzany.\n\nHopefuls to join the guild need sponsorship from an existing member in order to pledge themselves, and are taught about swordsmanship and honor. The three requirements for induction as a full Duelist are: to be questioned on the Code and the Virtues and found satisfactory by a member of the Senior Triad; conduct a duel from beginning to finish as either a primary (challenger or challenged) or a second; and fight a combat to the blood, for any good and commendable cause or reason. Once these requirements are fulfilled, the candidate is put to a vote before the whole Society.\n\nAmong the privileges accorded by the royal charter of the Society of Duelists are the right to bear arms (to wit a rapier and a parrying dagger), wear certain distinctive articles of clothing (a cavalier hat and tabard), nominate teachers among the Society, and blanket sanction for duels involving a Duelist as a primary, or Duelists as seconds to both parties. Those hoping to become Duelists should contact any Duelist, recognizable by their plumed cavalier hats or their feather pins or their rapiers. Copies of the charter may be lent at request to those who are yet uncertain of their interest.",

          "text": "Courtesy and Friendship; Are They Mutually Exclusive?\nwrit by Lady SinvyCourtesy is such a complex part of civilized society that it is often misunderstood in many ways. There are two common misconceptions about the purpose and attitude relating to Courtesy. The first is that being courteous makes you a \"snob\" and that those who are courteous are \"snobs.\" The second being that being courteous means you must be friendly or friends with an individual.\n\nThe first misconception and the second tend to tie together more often than not. Someone who practices the virtue of Courtesy and therefore is courteous is in no way a snob, they are acting in a manner befitting a civilized being according to the established virtues of the society in which we live in now. Likewise, just because someone educates another in Courtesy, be it through example or direct verbal and written education does not make them a snob or mean they are being rude to you. There have been many times where I have heard or seen someone get upset or flat out angry because someone - no matter how politely - corrected them or acted correctly.\n\nAn example of such would be to individuals in the pillory or on distraint. It is not rude or inappropriate for someone to disregard these individuals as they are -beneath contempt- and have eschewed Her Majesty's generosity by refusing to follow the Law in which She has laid down for the benefit of everyone. Therefore, it is socially frowned upon to coddle these individuals, friend or not, because to encourage the breaking of the law endangers the whole of the population and Society.\n\nThe second misconception that seems to run rampant is that to be courteous one must be friendly. This is most certainly -not- the case. No where in our society does one imply the other and to assume such is considered inappropriate. Courtesy does not require that one smile, hug, nickname, inquire about the weather or even invite people to join them for cake. It does require that betters be acknowledged by lessers and that people adhere to the basic respect afforded to all individuals not under arrest or held outside of Her Majesty's good graces.\n\nI have often heard chatter about how rude an individual was, only to learn that they had simply not been bursting with enthusiasm, being in possession of a bubbling disposition or in the mood to socialize with and coddle their peers or lessers. While I can see how this could be off putting for the majority of our population, it is always important to remember that not everyone is or even wishes to be friends with everyone else, and that because they choose this path does not make them discourteous, but merely makes them human.\n\nIn short, being courteous to others does not make you a snob, it means you are bettering your character by pursuing one of the society's key virtues and just because someone is courteous does not mean they are expected to be your friend or have to act as if they are. The Courtesy Circle asks that you keep these in mind when interacting with your peers and betters and try not to cultivate perceptions that are incorrect and impede your own virtue.\nUpcoming EventsDo you have your calendar ready? Mark the dates for these upcoming events:\n\nThe Winter Ball\nThe Aristocracy is eagerly awaiting the Winter Ball, planned by the Mistress of Entertainments, Mistress Ranowan Ophidias. Scheduled to begin at 9 late bells on the twenty-third day of this moon, the magical evening will take its guests to the Avalonian Ballroom, located through the silver archway in the Inner Bailey's Winter Gardens. This event is for members of the Court and their guests only.\n\nLove, Respect & Admiration\nFor those unable to attend the Winter Ball (and even those who can!), there is an Outer Bailey event scheduled for the twelfth day, starting at seven late bells, in the Bowling Lounge. Hosted by seras Carla and Euphelia, the event allows Her Majesty's Guests to anonymously submit the names of those they love (whether it is romantic or platonic), respect and admire, ensuring the person of note receives a special invitation and gift. Anonymous submissions received after the tenth may not have specific invitations sent out, but submissions will be welcome to the gift hand-out.

          "text": "Courtesy in Love and Romance\n writ by Lady Sinvy\nMuch  of the time we must focus on  the basics of Courtesy. How to bow, when  to nod, why to curtsy and to  whom and so forth. However, there is a  topic within the layers of  Courtesy that touches on one of the softer  sides of human nature; Love  and Romance.   Affection is not limited to rank*, race or gender. It is a universal   emotion felt by everyone to some degree. You may feel it toward a   garment, toward an animal or toward a person, but it is felt. We shall   be discussing human affection today. \n While the basics of Courtship Courtesy have  been explored in previous  Courtesy in a Nutshell editions, I wish  explore how Courtship Courtesy  and Fine Amour interact. \n\n The art of Fine Amour is the decorous display  of love and adoration from  an appropriate distance. Fine Amour is the  epitome of Courtly Romance,  suitable to be practiced by all ranks. It  is typically reserved for  those who are unattainable, by being within a  Courtship (not to be  confused with Suiting), by being Wed or by being  highly ranked. This  does -not- mean it is exclusive as such. \n\n Fine Amour at its core is the art of wooing  and being wooed. This is an  important part of interaction between a  couple as it breeds deeper  affection and more fulfilling romance. It  is, to me, an essential  component to any part of the Courtship process.  \n\n It plays its most important role during the  process of Suiting and being  Suited. There are a couple of reasons for  this. During the process of  suiting or being suited, you are trying to  earn or gain the affection of  someone through your own merits, deeds  and so forth. This is -not- an  assured victory to their heart, so you  bear yourself to the individual  without expectation of their romance.  It is a pure display of the heart. \n The ultimate goal, in most cases, of pressing  suit is to win the heart  of the individual you are pressing suit to.  To quote from the Courtesy  in a Nutshell on Courtship Courtesy; \n\n\"If a couple is only suiting the bare minimum  of contact and privacy  should be had as this is the friendly stage  where you get to know each  other mentally and emotionally. Escorting  and the kissing of hands is  acceptable. One should not linger overmuch  in their direct presence or  frequently vanish to unknown locations as  this gives the impression that  they are more than suiting.\" \n\n As previously stated, Fine Amour and Pressing  Suit are intertwined. You  press suit to an individual without the  expectation of reciprocation. In  doing such, you enter into a state of  play with the individual; you  trying to win their heart and they are  trying to deter you from or allow  you to as they will. This is the  proving grounds of Romance. \n\n The appropriate actions of one pressing suit  are to be courteous and  respectful to the individual you are interested  in and vice verse. This  should be an action to anyone, but it becomes  more intimate once you  decide you wish to know someone better. You may  grant unto them poetry,  compliments, small gifts and may serve as  escort** to them for social  events. You must not crowd them, treat them  as \"yours\" or be  disrespectful of their personal space. If you are  being suited, you may  treat them as you please, so long as it is  polite. You do not need to  accept their gifts, nor are you expected to  gift them in return, you may  thank them for the poetry, and accept  their escort. \n\n In many cases, the affection and suit are  reciprocated - eventually.  However, in some cases the other party is  merely uninterested. You may  continue to press suit to the individual,  but be careful it does not  hinge on obsessive behaviour. If you are  being suited by an individual  or individuals that you do not care to  get to know, wish them to cease  and so forth, merely ask them. If they  persist in a manner you find  inappropriate or intimidating, it is then  suggested you seek the  Courtesy Circle, Winter Watch or Royal Guard as  it has clearly turned  into unacceptable attention. \n\n * It is limited to rank in how it may be pursued though.\n** Not an official escort if the individual is an un-Knighted member of Court\n\nThe Adventures of Noggin and Narf\n Ch. 1 - The Seer, Crazybeard\n writ by an Anonymous StorytellerOnce  upon a time, in a frozen  tundra far, far away, lived two adventuring  souls by the names of Noggin  and Narf. These two lads had battled  skeletons, had triumphed over  ogres and trolls, and even bearded a  dragon in its own den. Of course,  old Crazybeard hadn't liked that  much... \n\nNoggin, the leader of  the two, was a tall and strapping man, with dark  golden hair, the sort  that caught in a breeze and flew back from his  face in a dashing  manner. A single flutter of his eyelashes could send  seras all  a-flutter, and he walked with one hand on his sword hilt,  ready to beat  away the jealous men. A genial giant, Noggin easily  brokered deals and  was seen as a friendly, gullible fellow, for while  the gods had  blessed Noggin with a beautiful noggin, they had given him a  mostly  empty one. He was leader only because his partner had no use for  anyone  else. \n\nThat's Narf. Sarcastic and pessimistic,  Narf was handsome,  when he stopped scowling and smirking. Which he  never did. No one knew  what Narf's real name was. Legend says he was  given the name because  after he cut people to pieces with his sharp wit  and burned them with  his scorching tongue, it was the only sound his  victims could make. Narf  kept his hair covered by a blue bandana, and  under a hat. No one  touched Narf's hat--he had chopped people to pieces  over the plumed and  brimmed creation. If it wasn't for Noggin, whom he  stuck by for some  reason, Narf would have likely stooped to villainy,  if only for the  entertainment value. \n\n But keeping Noggin alive was Narf's  responsibility, given to him by the  Great Seer Dragon, Crazybeard, in  return for letting them live for  cutting off his centuries-long beard.  As the seer had said, cutting off a  dragon's beard was worthy of a  painful, slow death, but after a few  centuries, it did need a trim. \n\n With the money gained from Crazybeard, Noggin  and Narf had bought a  small snow-moss farm. All was well and two years  has passed when they  were summoned in dreams to attend the dragon  seer. The two made the long  and arduous trek up the mountainside,  battling through blizzard and  beast, to stand before the now  stubbly-chinned Crazybeard. \n\n \"'Lo, Crazystubble,\" Narf said, strutting  into the dragon's cave. The  resulting snort of sulfurous breath blew  the sarcastic mortal through  the cave's mouth, and would have launched  him off the side of the cliff  had not Noggin caught him in his handsome  arms. \n\n \"I have seen the futures, young humans,\"  Crazybeard rumbled, a trail of  smoke slithering from one fuzzy nostril.  \"There are three futures, and  one is most dire. What future comes  hinges on you two heroes. Do  nothing, and it will be the end of all.\" \n\n Noggin and Narf looked at each other briefly.  A breeze flowed through  Crazybeard's cave, blowing back Noggin's hair.  Noggin struck a pose, and  from somewhere, a beam of starlight struck  him, making him virtually  shine like a little god. Narf sighed. \n\n \"We will do what you bid us, Crazybeard,\" Noggin said, his voice heroically booming through the cave. \n\n \"What are our options?\" asked Narf. \"You said there were three.\" \n Crazybeard snaked his large head down to peer  at Narf, huffing at the  human's temerity. His foul dragon's breath  blew the hat right off Narf's  head, while dashingly ruffling the nearby  Noggin's golden mane. Noggin  shifted his pose slightly, becoming  somehow more heroic. \n Narf spit on the floor, then fetched his hat. \n\n \"Impetuous human!\" roared Crazybeard. \"I will tell you nothing but this: NORTH or SOUTH, you will affect the future and fates. Stay and doom is certain! Go SOUTH and only one man returns. GO NORTH and you will MULTIPLY.\" \n\n \"That makes it easy,\" beamed Noggin. \"Let's head north!\" \n\n Narf shook his head. \"Let's go south. Please. South.\" \n\n Which direction should Noggin and Narf travel? Send your choices to Euphelia before Y14-03-20 to affect the tale.\n\n* Some characters in Noggin and Narf may appear to resemble residents of Castle Marrach.

How to bow, when  to nod, why to curtsy and to  whom and so forth. However, there is a  topic within the layers of  Courtesy that touches on one of the softer  sides of human nature; Love  and Romance. </span><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">  Affection is not limited to rank*, race or gender. It is a universal   emotion felt by everyone to some degree. You may feel it toward a   garment, toward an animal or toward a person, but it is felt. We shall   be discussing human affection today. </span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> While the basics of Courtship Courtesy have  been explored in previous  Courtesy in a Nutshell editions, I wish  explore how Courtship Courtesy  and Fine Amour interact. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> The art of Fine Amour is the decorous display  of love and adoration from  an appropriate distance. Fine Amour is the  epitome of Courtly Romance,  suitable to be practiced by all ranks. It  is typically reserved for  those who are unattainable, by being within a  Courtship (not to be  confused with Suiting), by being Wed or by being  highly ranked. This  does -not- mean it is exclusive as such. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> Fine Amour at its core is the art of wooing  and being wooed. This is an  important part of interaction between a  couple as it breeds deeper  affection and more fulfilling romance. It  is, to me, an essential  component to any part of the Courtship process.  </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> It plays its most important role during the  process of Suiting and being  Suited. There are a couple of reasons for  this. During the process of  suiting or being suited, you are trying to  earn or gain the affection of  someone through your own merits, deeds  and so forth. This is -not- an  assured victory to their heart, so you  bear yourself to the individual  without expectation of their romance.  It is a pure display of the heart. </span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> The ultimate goal, in most cases, of pressing  suit is to win the heart  of the individual you are pressing suit to.  To quote from the Courtesy  in a Nutshell on Courtship Courtesy; </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">&quot;If a couple is only suiting the bare minimum  of contact and privacy  should be had as this is the friendly stage  where you get to know each  other mentally and emotionally. Escorting  and the kissing of hands is  acceptable. One should not linger overmuch  in their direct presence or  frequently vanish to unknown locations as  this gives the impression that  they are more than suiting.&quot; </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> As previously stated, Fine Amour and Pressing  Suit are intertwined. You  press suit to an individual without the  expectation of reciprocation. In  doing such, you enter into a state of  play with the individual; you  trying to win their heart and they are  trying to deter you from or allow  you to as they will. This is the  proving grounds of Romance. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> The appropriate actions of one pressing suit  are to be courteous and  respectful to the individual you are interested  in and vice verse. This  should be an action to anyone, but it becomes  more intimate once you  decide you wish to know someone better. You may  grant unto them poetry,  compliments, small gifts and may serve as  escort** to them for social  events. You must not crowd them, treat them  as &quot;yours&quot; or be  disrespectful of their personal space. If you are  being suited, you may  treat them as you please, so long as it is  polite. You do not need to  accept their gifts, nor are you expected to  gift them in return, you may  thank them for the poetry, and accept  their escort. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> In many cases, the affection and suit are  reciprocated - eventually.  However, in some cases the other party is  merely uninterested. You may  continue to press suit to the individual,  but be careful it does not  hinge on obsessive behaviour. If you are  being suited by an individual  or individuals that you do not care to  get to know, wish them to cease  and so forth, merely ask them. If they  persist in a manner you find  inappropriate or intimidating, it is then  suggested you seek the  Courtesy Circle, Winter Watch or Royal Guard as  it has clearly turned  into unacceptable attention. </span><br>\n<br>\n <span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">* It is limited to rank in how it may be pursued though.<br>\n** Not an official escort if the individual is an un-Knighted member of Court<br>\n<br>\n</span></div><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><span style=\"font-size:48px\">T</span></span><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><span style=\"font-size:28px\">he Adventures of Noggin and Narf</span></span><br>\n <span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">Ch. 1 - The Seer, Crazybeard</span></span><br>\n <span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><i>writ by an Anonymous Storyteller</i></span><div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">O</span></span><span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">nce  upon a time, in a frozen  tundra far, far away, lived two adventuring  souls by the names of Noggin  and Narf. These two lads had battled  skeletons, had triumphed over  ogres and trolls, and even bearded a  dragon in its own den. Of course,  old Crazybeard hadn&apos;t liked that  much... </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">Noggin, the leader of  the two, was a tall and strapping man, with dark  golden hair, the sort  that caught in a breeze and flew back from his  face in a dashing  manner. A single flutter of his eyelashes could send  seras all  a-flutter, and he walked with one hand on his sword hilt,  ready to beat  away the jealous men. A genial giant, Noggin easily  brokered deals and  was seen as a friendly, gullible fellow, for while  the gods had  blessed Noggin with a beautiful noggin, they had given him a  mostly  empty one. He was leader only because his partner had no use for  anyone  else. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\">That&apos;s Narf. Sarcastic and pessimistic,  Narf was handsome,  when he stopped scowling and smirking. Which he  never did. No one knew  what Narf&apos;s real name was. Legend says he was  given the name because  after he cut people to pieces with his sharp wit  and burned them with  his scorching tongue, it was the only sound his  victims could make. Narf  kept his hair covered by a blue bandana, and  under a hat. No one  touched Narf&apos;s hat--he had chopped people to pieces  over the plumed and  brimmed creation. If it wasn&apos;t for Noggin, whom he  stuck by for some  reason, Narf would have likely stooped to villainy,  if only for the  entertainment value. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> But keeping Noggin alive was Narf&apos;s  responsibility, given to him by the  Great Seer Dragon, Crazybeard, in  return for letting them live for  cutting off his centuries-long beard.  As the seer had said, cutting off a  dragon&apos;s beard was worthy of a  painful, slow death, but after a few  centuries, it did need a trim. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> With the money gained from Crazybeard, Noggin  and Narf had bought a  small snow-moss farm. All was well and two years  has passed when they  were summoned in dreams to attend the dragon  seer. The two made the long  and arduous trek up the mountainside,  battling through blizzard and  beast, to stand before the now  stubbly-chinned Crazybeard. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> &quot;&apos;Lo, Crazystubble,&quot; Narf said, strutting  into the dragon&apos;s cave. The  resulting snort of sulfurous breath blew  the sarcastic mortal through  the cave&apos;s mouth, and would have launched  him off the side of the cliff  had not Noggin caught him in his handsome  arms. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> &quot;I have seen the futures, young humans,&quot;  Crazybeard rumbled, a trail of  smoke slithering from one fuzzy nostril.  &quot;There are three futures, and  one is most dire. What future comes  hinges on you two heroes. Do  nothing, and it will be the end of all.&quot; </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> Noggin and Narf looked at each other briefly.  A breeze flowed through  Crazybeard&apos;s cave, blowing back Noggin&apos;s hair.  Noggin struck a pose, and  from somewhere, a beam of starlight struck  him, making him virtually  shine like a little god. Narf sighed. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> &quot;We will do what you bid us, Crazybeard,&quot; Noggin said, his voice heroically booming through the cave. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> &quot;What are our options?&quot; asked Narf. &quot;You said there were three.&quot; </span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> Crazybeard snaked his large head down to peer  at Narf, huffing at the  human&apos;s temerity. His foul dragon&apos;s breath  blew the hat right off Narf&apos;s  head, while dashingly ruffling the nearby  Noggin&apos;s golden mane. Noggin  shifted his pose slightly, becoming  somehow more heroic. </span><br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> Narf spit on the floor, then fetched his hat. </span><br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua\"> &quot;Impetuous human!&quot; roared Crazybeard. &quot;I will tell you nothing but this: <b>NORTH</b> or <b>SOUTH</b>, you will affect the future and fates.

To look upon her, you would see a short, milky-pale-skinned woman wearing baggy pants and slippers, bedecked in jewelry. She looks like she is more ready for browsing Master Ali-Jahib's bazaar than getting into the middle of a supernatural battle.\n\nBut that is precisely what sera Tamiko found herself in when she left her room one night.\n\n\"Well I had just walked out of my room and I saw an old man on the ground and he was surrounded by the red wraith... I didn't know who he was at the time as I've never seen him before.\"\n\nThe old man she saw lying helpless was Master Odebain, the Royal Witchfinder. In this case, one of the supernatural threats he is charged with defending against seem to have caught him off guard and had overwhelmed him.\n\nTamiko was faced with a horror that nearly drove her mad. She could barely describe the spectre that overwhelmed both her and Master Odebain. It appeared as if someone scratched blood-red ink across a page, but wondered if that even made any sense, 'It was red and shaky.'\n\n\"The first thing I did was try and cover him,\" meaning Master Odebain, \"But the thing kept trying to get at him. It tried to get under his eye patch.\"\n\nIt was then that Tamiko herself began to succumb to the overwhelming compelling force of the spectre herself. \"I screamed and screamed and then suddenly I got the urge to hurt myself. Voices were telling me to scratch at my face and it was so very hard to resist.\"\n\nIf this wraith could overcome Master Odebain, what chance did Tamiko stand against it?\n\n\"I scratched my face enough to draw blood but I managed to blow my duckcall...\" The next few minutes were a living nightmare. Tamiko was alone for about five or so minutes, \"maybe even longer,\" before Watchwoman Galatea, arrived, with Cordon and Euphelia arriving shortly after.\n\n\"It kept... shocking us with some sort of force or energy.\"\n\nTamiko and the rest were subjected to waves of overwhelming raw emotions from the wraith which washed over them as it swarmed around the Royal Witchfinder's body.\n\n\"It was very angry. Very frustrated that it could not get that thing under Master Odebain's eye patch. Everytime it tried, red lightning would errupt.\"\n\nWhat Tamiko did not know then, but what been discovered since, is that the eye under Master Odebain's eyepatch is actually the magical focus of Esme, a long-dead sorcerer in a secret cabal known as the Hand of Five, who worked for the Black Rose, known as Caletus.\n\nWatchwoman Galatea confirmed Tamiko's story, \"The Red Specter attempted to steal something from beneath Master Odebain's eyepatch, but a bright light erupted from it and pierced the specter, that's what drove it away.\"\n\nAfter the creature departed, Tamiko reported, \"the urges sort of... faded away.\" As did the wraith itself.\n\nTamiko concluded her story, \"The thing went away after a time. It became very very frustrated and then just... disappeared. But it left Odebain in some sort of..magical coma.\"\n\nThese ghastly events occurred on the 25th of the 10th Moon, of the 14th Year of the Recent Awakenings. Since then, there has been no official report released on what occurred to Master Odebain. However, sources tell this reporter that the Master was taken first to be seen by healers, and remains incapacitated, safeguarded currently in a room in the Inner Bailey.\n\nThe day after, the 26th of the 10th Moon, the entire event was reported to Lord Boreas. However, the proceedings of that meeting remain confidential.\n\nThis reporter remains keenly interested in any additional details regarding the appearance of the spectre, the incapacitation of Master Odebain, and any other news related to the story of \"the Black Rose\" Caletus and the Hand of Five.",
